# GitLab has a comprehensive style guide

GitLab has a comprehensive style guide that covers various aspects of software development, including coding, testing, and documentation. Here are some key points from the GitLab style guide:

Code formatting: GitLab recommends using the standard formatting for the programming language you are using. It also suggests using tools like RuboCop, ESLint, or Prettier to automate formatting.

Naming conventions: GitLab suggests using descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes. It also recommends using camelCase for variables and functions in JavaScript, and snake_case for variables and functions in Ruby.

Comments: GitLab advises developers to write comments that explain why the code is written in a certain way, rather than what the code does. It also recommends avoiding unnecessary comments, such as commenting out code instead of deleting it.

Testing: GitLab suggests writing automated tests for your code, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. It also recommends using a testing framework like RSpec or Jest.

Documentation: GitLab recommends writing documentation for your code, including README files, inline comments, and API documentation. It also suggests using tools like Swagger to generate API documentation automatically.

Security: GitLab advises following secure coding practices, such as avoiding hard-coded passwords, using secure libraries, and validating user input.

Code reviews: GitLab recommends using code reviews to ensure code quality and catch potential bugs before they make it into production.

These are just a few key points from the GitLab style guide. For more detailed information, you can check out the GitLab handbook on their website.
