## what is Satipaṭṭhāna

Satipaṭṭhāna, also known as the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, is a central meditation practice in Theravada Buddhism. It is a systematic method for developing mindfulness and insight into the nature of reality. The word "satipaṭṭhāna" is derived from two Pali words, "sati" which means mindfulness or awareness, and "paṭṭhāna" which means establishment.

The Four Foundations of Mindfulness are:

- Mindfulness of the body (kāyānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna)
- Mindfulness of feelings (vedanānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna)
- Mindfulness of the mind (cittānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna)
- Mindfulness of mental objects (dhammānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna)

The goal of satipaṭṭhāna meditation is to cultivate a deep awareness of all aspects of one's experience, including physical sensations, thoughts, emotions, and mental objects. This awareness leads to insight into the impermanence and non-self nature of all phenomena, which in turn leads to the ending of suffering.

Satipaṭṭhāna meditation is often taught in Theravada Buddhist monasteries and retreat centers, and is considered a powerful tool for developing mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. It is also widely practiced in the West as a secular form of mindfulness meditation.
