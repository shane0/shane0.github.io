## a rant after 5 years of studying buddhism

I wish I had a webpage like this one when I started...

tmi: my journey

i started studying meditaiton and variations of buddhism during covid

so reading books, watching videos, attending online events

there's way tmi about buddhism, for starters buddha taught 84,000 paths to enlightenment

the pali canon is a big old bookshelf

despite all that info everyone and their cousin wrote another book on meditation and sold it

english translations are often translations of translations of variations of buddhism as it spread to other countries

each of these variations below added a bunch of new jargon

after dozens of books in these variations below I settled on [tldr](#tldr-too-long-didnt-read)

## variations

- [buddhism by country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_by_country)

```mermaid

hinduism -- thousands+ years old --> buddhism
buddhism -- east --> theravada 
buddhism -- tibet --> mahayana 
buddhism -- tibet --> vajrayana 
buddhism -- tibet --> dzogchen
buddhism -- china and japan --> zen 
```
