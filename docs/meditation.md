| Anicca                             | Refers to the idea that all things are constantly changing and in a state of flux. Nothing in the world is permanent, and everything is subject to birth, aging, sickness, and death.                                                                                                                                              |
| Dukkha                             | Refers to the idea that all things in the world are inherently unsatisfactory and cannot provide lasting happiness or fulfillment.

| Anatta                             | Refers to the idea that there is no fixed or permanent self or soul. Rather, our sense of self is an ever-changing product of our thoughts, emotions, and experiences. The concept of anatta is closely related to the idea of emptiness (shunyata), which is the ultimate nature of all phenomena according to Mahayana Buddhism. |
