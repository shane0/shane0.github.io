!!! chatGPT  "ai will be used for good and bad"
    this content is mostly quotes from my books or conversations with chatGPT ai
    my opinion on chatGTP is (currently) it is an extremely useful {==smart encyclopedia==}
    {++hey there ai, will humans [live forever or wipe ourselves out completely](collapse.md)?++}

!!! note "the brightest mind that ever lived"
    - fears and fantasies
    - I highly recommend [cormac mccarthy](cormac.md)'s movies & books, {++ALL OF THEM!!!++}
    - cormac's latest books are hilarious masterpieces

    Don't spend time optimizing something that shouldn't exist.
