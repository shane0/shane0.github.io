| "War is the great scavenger of thought." | The Crossing |
| "If there is no God to forgive us, then we must forgive ourselves." | The Crossing |
| "The truth about the world, he said, is that anything is possible. Had you not seen it all from birth and thereby bled it of its strangeness it would appear to you for what it is, a hat trick in a medicine show, a fevered dream, a trance bepopulate with chimeras having neither analogue nor precedent, an itinerant carnival, a migratory tentshow whose ultimate destination after many a pitch in many a mudded field is unspeakable and calamitous beyond reckoning." | Blood Meridian |
| "If you don't know you're dying then death can come and go and you won't even know it." | The Crossing |
| "The man who believes that the secrets of the world are forever hidden lives in mystery and fear. Superstition will drag him down. The rain will erode the deeds of his life. But that man who sets himself the task of singling out the thread of order from the tapestry will by the decision alone have taken charge of the world and it is only by such taking charge that he will effect a way to dictate the terms of his own fate." | Blood Meridian |

| "Anything that happens, happens. It doesn't necessarily do it in chronological order, though." | Doctor Who and Philosophy: Bigger on the Inside |
| "The universe is no narrow thing and the order within it is not constrained by any latitude in its conception to repeat what exists in one part in any other part. Even in this world more things exist without our knowledge than with it and the order in creation which you see is that which you have put there, like a string in a maze, so that you shall not lose your way." | Blood Meridian |

### drives the tale

!!! warning "that what drives the tale will not survive the tale"

this is consistent with the broader theme of IMPERMANENCE and the fleeting nature of the universe and human existence that runs throughout much of cormac mccarthy's work

characters often struggle against the forces of time, nature, and death, often with tragic results

the ephemeral nature of everything, particles, planets, life

### destruction

!!! warning "The world has created no living thing that it does not intend to destroy"

- see [benefits of impermanence](../buddhism/impermenence.md)

This statement could be interpreted as a bleak outlook on life and the world as a whole, suggesting that everything that exists is ultimately doomed to destruction. It might reflect a belief that the very act of creation leads to destruction, and that everything that is born is destined to die.

In the context of Cormac McCarthy's work, this statement is consistent with his themes of violence and the cycle of life and death. Many of his characters struggle against the forces of nature, violence, and death, often with tragic results.

However, it's worth noting that this statement is not a universal truth and that there are many examples of things that persist and endure in the world, such as love, relationships, and cultural heritage. Ultimately, whether one agrees with this statement or not likely depends on one's individual perspective and worldview.

### drawings

!!! warning "You can’t get hold of the world. You can only draw a picture. Whether it’s a bull on the wall of a cave or a partial differential equation it’s all the same thing"

This idea aligns with broader philosophical and epistemological debates about the limits of human knowledge and understanding, and the extent to which we can ever truly know or comprehend the world around us. Ultimately, it suggests that our attempts to represent and understand the world are always imperfect and that there is always more to discover and understand.

### nature of reality

!!! warning "You got stuff here that is maybe just virtual and maybe not but still the rules have got to be in it"

This statement is suggesting that there are things in the world that may or may not exist in a physical sense, but still have rules that govern their behavior and interactions. For example, in modern computing, virtual objects and environments can be created using computer simulations and algorithms, even though they don't have a physical existence in the real world. However, these virtual objects still follow certain rules and behaviors, such as those defined by the software and programming that created them.

This idea highlights the importance of rules and structure in shaping our understanding and experience of the world, regardless of whether that world is physical or virtual. Whether we're dealing with the laws of physics, the rules of a game, or the algorithms that govern a computer simulation, these rules provide a framework for understanding and interacting with the world, and help us make sense of the complex and ever-changing reality that surrounds us.

| Themes      | The novel explores themes of violence, humanity's relationship with nature, and the nature of evil.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Style       | The novel is written in McCarthy's signature poetic style, with a focus on vivid imagery and sparse punctuation.

| Reception   | "Blood Meridian" received mixed reviews upon its release, with some critics praising McCarthy's writing and others criticizing the book for its extreme violence and nihilistic worldview. However, the book has since become a cult classic and is widely regarded as one of McCarthy's greatest works. |

| War is God.                                                | The Judge believes that violence and war are divine forces that shape the world.                            |
| The world is a machine, and men are parts of that machine. | The Judge sees humanity as a component of the larger, mechanical universe.                                  |
| History is predetermined and inevitable.                   | The Judge believes that the course of history is predetermined, and that humans are powerless to change it. |
| Life has no intrinsic value.                               | The Judge sees life as expendable, and views death as a necessary and natural part of existence.            |
| Knowledge is power.                                        | The Judge is constantly seeking knowledge and information, and uses it to gain power over others.           |
| The strong have a duty to rule over the weak.              | The Judge believes that the strong and intelligent should dominate and control the weak and ignorant.       |
| Nature is indifferent to humanity.                         | The Judge sees nature as a force that operates independently of human interests and desires.                |
