# python vs js vs ps

- I learned python before I learned js
- I learned powershell in between (don't tell anyone that)
- because of this experience js looks strange
- but if I'm going to talk smack I need to have some examples to back it up

## in a range

```py
for x in range(10):
    print(x)
```

```json
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
```

```powershell
for ($x = 0; $x -lt 10; $x++) {
    Write-Output $x
}
```

## random
