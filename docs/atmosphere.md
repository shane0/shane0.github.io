# earth's atmosphere

- to sustain life on earth requires interdependancies:
- the sun
- water
- air

## forms

- solid
- liquid
- gas

## greenhouse gas 

This estimate would result in a total mass of CO2 in the atmosphere of around 3 trillion metric tons, or approximately 6.6 trillion pounds.

to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations from preindustrial levels (which were around 280 parts per million) is likely to cause a global average temperature increase {==between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 and 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit)==}

To achieve a doubling of CO2 concentrations, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 would need to reach around 560 parts per million. Currently, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 is around 417 parts per million (as of 2019).
