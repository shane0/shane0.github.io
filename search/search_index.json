From Zen Flesh, Zen Bones*</p> <p>Zen is nothing new, neither is it anything old. Long before Buddha was born the search was on in India, as the present work shows.</p> <p>Long after man has forgotten such words as Zen and Buddha, satori and koan, China and Japan and America \u2013 still the search will go on, still Zen will be seen even in flower, and grass-blade, before the sun.</p> <p>The following is adapted from the preface to the first version in English of this ancient work.</p> <p>Wandering in the ineffable beauty of Kashmir, above Srinagar I come upon the hermitage of Lakshmanjoo.</p> <p>It overlooks green rice fields, the garden, of Shalimar and Nishat Bagh, lakes fringed with lotus. Water streams down from a mountaintop.</p> <p>Here Lakshmanjoo \u2013 tall, full bodied, shining \u2013 welcomes me. He shares with me this ancient teaching from the Vigyan Bhairava and Sochanda Tantra, both written about four thousand years ago, and from Malini Vijaya Tantra, probably another thousand years older yet. It is an ancient teaching, copied and recopied countless times, and from it Lakshmanjoo has made the beginning of an English version. I transcribe it eleven more times to get it into the form given here.</p> <p>Shiva first chanted it to his consort Devi in a language of love we have yet to learn. It is about the Immanent experience. It presents 112 ways to open the invisible door of consciousness. I see Lakshmanjoo gives his life to its practicing.</p> <p>Some of the ways may appear redundant, yet each differs from any other. Some may seem simple, yet any one requires constant dedication even to test it.</p> <p>Machines, ledgers, dancers, athletes balance. Just as centering or balance augments various skills, so it may awareness. As an experiment, try standing equally on both feet; then imagine you are shifting your balance slightly from foot to foot: just as balance centers, do you.</p> <p>If we are conscious in part, this implies more inclusive consciousness. Have you a hand? Yes. That you know without doubt. But until asked the question were you cognizant of the hand apart?</p> <p>Surely men as inspiritors, known and unknown to the world, have shared a common uncommon discovery. The Tao of Lao-tse, Nirvana of Buddha, Jehovah of Moses, the Father of Jesus, the Allah of Mohammed \u2014 all point to the experience.</p> <p>No-thing-ness, spirit \u2013 once touched, the whole life clears.</p> <p>DEVI SAYS:</p> <pre><code>O Shiva, what is your reality?\nWhat is this wonder-filled universe?\nWhat constitutes seed?\nWho centers the universal wheel?\nWhat is tbis life beyond form pervading forms?\nHow may we enter it fully, above space and\ntime, names and descriptions?\nLet my doubts be cleared!\n</code></pre> <p>SHIVA REPLIES</p> <p>[Devi, though already enlightened, has asked the foregoing questions so others through the universe might receive Shiva\u2019s instructions.

This is difficult only for the impure.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider your essence as light rays rising from center to center up the vertebrae, and so rises livingness in you.</p> </li> <li> <p>Or in the spaces between, feel this as lightning.</p> </li> <li> <p>Devi, imagine the Sanskrit letters in these honey-filled foci of awareness, first as letters, then more subtly as sounds, then as most subtle feeling. Then, leaving them aside, be free.</p> </li> <li> <p>Attention between eyebrows, let mind be before thought. Let form fill with breath-essence to the top of the head, and there shower as light.</p> </li> <li> <p>Or, imagine the five-colored circles of the peacock tail to be your five senses in illimitable space. Now let their beauty melt within. Similarly, at any point in space or on a wall \u2014 until the point dissolves. Then your wish for another comes true.</p> </li> <li> <p>Eyes closed, see your inner being in detail. Thus see your true nature.</p> </li> <li> <p>Place your whole attention in the nerve, delicate as the lotus thread, in the center of your spinal column. In such be transformed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Closing the seven openings of the head with your hands, a space between your eyes becomes all-inclusive.</p> </li> <li> <p>Touching eyeballs as a feather, lightness between them opens into heart and there permeates the cosmos.</p> </li> <li> <p>Bathe in the center of sound, as in the continuous sound of a waterfall. Or, by putting fingers in ears, hear the sound of sounds.</p> </li> <li> <p>Intone a sound, as a-u-m, slowly. As sound enters soundfulness, so do you.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the beginning and gradual refinement of the sound of any letter, awake.</p> </li> <li> <p>While listening to stringed instruments, hear their composite central sound; thus omnipresence.</p> </li> <li> <p>Intone a sound audibly, then less and less audibly as feeling deepens into this silent harmony.</p> </li> <li> <p>Imagine spirit simultaneously within and around you until the entire universe spiritualizes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kind Devi, enter etheric presence pervading far above and below your form.</p> </li> <li> <p>Put mindstuff in such inexpressible fineness above, below, and in your heart.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider any area of your present form as limitlessly spacious.</p> </li> <li> <p>Feel your substance, bones, flesh, blood, saturated with cosmic essence.</p> </li> <li> <p>Suppose your passive form to be an empty room with walls of skin \u2013 empty.</p> </li> <li> <p>Blessed one, as senses are absorbed in heart, reach the center of the lotus.</p> </li> <li> <p>Unminding mind, keep in the middle \u2013 until.</p> </li> <li> <p>When in worldly activity, keep attentive between the two breaths, and so practicing, in a few days be born anew.

In a few moments become aware.</p> </li> <li> <p>Abide in some place endlessly spacious, clear of trees, hills, habitations. Thence comes the end of mind pressures.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sweet-hearted one, meditate on knowing and not knowing, existing and not existing. Then leave both aside that you may be.</p> </li> <li> <p>Look lovingly on some object Do not go on to another object. Here, in the middle of this object \u2014 the blessing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Feel cosmos as translucent ever-living presence.</p> </li> <li> <p>With utmost devotion, center on the two junctions of breath and know the knower.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider the plenum to be your own body of bliss.</p> </li> <li> <p>While being caressed, sweet princess, enter the caressing as everlasting life.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stop the doors of senses when feeling the creeping of an ant. Then.</p> </li> <li> <p>At the start of sexual union, keep attention on the fire in the beginning, and, so continuing, avoid the embers in the end.</p> </li> <li> <p>When in such embrace your senses are shaken as leaves, enter this shaking.</p> </li> <li> <p>Even remembering union, without the embrace, the transformation.</p> </li> <li> <p>On joyously seeing a long-absent friend, permeate this joy.</p> </li> <li> <p>When eating or drinking, become the taste of the food or drink, and be filled.</p> </li> <li> <p>0 lotus-eyed one, sweet of touch, when singing, seeing, tasting, be aware you are and discover the ever-living.</p> </li> <li> <p>Wherever satisfaction is found, in whatever act, actualize this.</p> </li> <li> <p>At the point of sleep when sleep has not yet come and external wakefulness vanishes, at this point being is revealed.

Opening eyes, see blackness. So faults disappear forever.</p> </li> <li> <p>Just as you have the impulse to do something, stop.</p> </li> <li> <p>Center on the sound a-u-m without any a or m</p> </li> <li> <p>Silently intone a word ending in AH. Then in the HH effortlessly, the spontaneity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Feel yourself as pervading all directions, far, near.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pierce some part of your nectar-filled form with a pin, and gently enter the piercing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Feel: My thought, I-ness, internal organs\u2014me.</p> </li> <li> <p>Illusions deceive. Colors circumscribe. Even divisibles are indivisible.</p> </li> <li> <p>When some desire comes, consider it. Then, suddenly, quit it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Before desire and before knowing, how can I say I am? Consider. Dissolve in the beauty.</p> </li> <li> <p>With your entire consciousness in the very start of desire, of knowing, know.</p> </li> <li> <p>0 Shakti, each particular perception is limited, disappearing in omnipotence.</p> </li> <li> <p>In truth forms are inseparate. Inseparate are omnipresent being and your own form. Realize each as made of this consciousness.</p> </li> <li> <p>In moods of extreme desire, be undisturbed.</p> </li> <li> <p>This so-called universe appears as a juggling, a picture show. To be happy look upon it so.</p> </li> <li> <p>0 Beloved, put attention neither on pleasure or pain but between these.</p> </li> <li> <p>Toss attachment for body aside, realizing I am everywhere. One who is everywhere is joyous.</p> </li> <li> <p>Objects and desires exist in me as in others. So accepting, let them be translated.</p> </li> <li> <p>The appreciation of objects and subjects is the same for an enlightened as for an unenlightened person.

At the instant of deprivation, transcend.</p> </li> <li> <p>Listen while the ultimate mystical teaching is imparted: Eyes still, without winking, at once become absolutely free.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stopping ears by pressing and rectum by contracting, enter the sound of sound.</p> </li> <li> <p>At the edge of a deep well look steadily into its depths until \u2014 the wondrousness.</p> </li> <li> <p>Wherever your mind is wandering, internally or externally at this very place, this.</p> </li> <li> <p>When vividly aware through some particular sense, keep in the awareness.</p> </li> <li> <p>At the start of sneezing, during fright, in anxiety, above a chasm, flying in battle, in extreme curiosity, at the beginning of hunger, at the end of hunger, be uninterruptedly aware.</p> </li> <li> <p>Let attention be at a place where you are seeing some past happening, and even your form, having lost its present characteristics, is transformed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Look upon some object, then slowly withdraw your sight from it, then slowly withdraw your thought from it. Then.</p> </li> <li> <p>Devotion frees.</p> </li> <li> <p>Feel an object before you. Feel the absence of all other objects but this one. Then, leaving aside the object-feeling and the absence-feeling, realize.</p> </li> <li> <p>The purity of other teachings is as impurity to us. In reality know nothing as pure or impure.</p> </li> <li> <p>This consciousness exists as each being, and nothing else exists.</p> </li> <li> <p>Be the unsame same to friend as to stranger, in honor and dishonor.</p> </li> <li> <p>When a mood against someone or for someone arises, do not place it on the person in question, but remain centered.</p> </li> <li> <p>Suppose you contemplate something beyond perception, beyond grasping, beyond not being, you.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enter space, supportless, eternal, still.</p> </li> <li> <p>Wherever your attention alights, at this very point, experience.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enter the sound of your name and, through this sound, all sounds.</p> </li> <li> <p>I am existing.

Dissolving of subject and object is the pure form of the deity.

It is only when forgetting the essence that the \u201cexpression\u201d takes the form of a thought.</p> <p>But the moment you recognize your own expression, it arises out of yourself, dissolves back into yourself, meaning dissolves into the expanse of the essence.
