In Buddhism, karma refers to the law of cause and effect, where actions and intentions determine the experiences that a person will have in future lives. The following are some of the key attributes of karma in Buddhism:

- Volitional Action: Karma is based on the principle of volitional action, meaning that the intentions and motivations behind an action are key factors in determining its effects.
- Ethical Quality: Karma is closely tied to ethics, as actions that cause harm to others and actions that help others both have consequences in terms of future experiences.
- Interdependent Nature: Karma is seen as interdependent, meaning that all actions and experiences are interconnected and the effects of an action depend on a variety of factors.
- Moment to Moment Experience: The effects of karma are experienced moment to moment, as opposed to being determined by a single action.
- Universal Applicability: Karma is considered to apply to all beings and not just humans, and it is not restricted by time or place.

It is important to note that the understanding of karma can vary between different Buddhist traditions, and that the above attributes are not exhaustive.
