Discourse on the Not-self Characteristic.

It is one of the most important discourses in Buddhism, and it is found in the Pali Canon, which is the collection of scriptures in Theravada Buddhism.

In this discourse, the Buddha explains how the idea of a self is formed through the interaction of the five aggregates (form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness). He explains that each of the aggregates is not self, impermanent, and subject to suffering. The idea of a self is formed when the aggregates are mistaken to be self, or when they are clung to as self.

The Buddha explains that this misunderstanding of the aggregates as self is the root of all suffering, and that the practice of understanding the not-self characteristic is crucial to attaining liberation from suffering.

Forgetting the self and embracing non-duality are concepts that are often associated with various spiritual and philosophical traditions, such as Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta.

Advantages of forgetting the self:

- Reduced suffering: One of the main goals of forgetting the self is to reduce suffering, which is often caused by our attachment to our ego or self-identity. By letting go of this attachment and realizing the impermanence and interconnectedness of all things, we can reduce our suffering and find inner peace.
- Increased empathy and compassion: Forgetting the self can also lead to a greater sense of empathy and compassion towards others. When we recognize that we are all interconnected and that our individual identities are temporary, we may be more inclined to treat others with kindness and understanding.
- Increased creativity and intuition: By forgetting the self, we can also tap into a deeper level of consciousness that is often associated with increased creativity and intuition. When we let go of our ego-driven thoughts and judgments, we may be more open to new ideas and insights.

Advantages of non-duality:

- Sense of oneness: Non-duality is the idea that there is no separation between the self and the universe, or between subject and object. Embracing this concept can lead to a sense of oneness with all things, which can be a profound and transformative experience.
- Greater awareness and clarity: Non-duality can also lead to a greater sense of awareness and clarity, as we begin to see through the illusions created by our ego and mental constructs. By recognizing that everything is interconnected and part of a greater whole, we may gain a deeper understanding of the nature of reality.
- Reduced stress and anxiety: Non-duality can also lead to a sense of inner peace and reduced stress and anxiety. By letting go of our attachment to our individual identity and recognizing the impermanence of all things, we may be more accepting of the present moment and less caught up in worries about the future or regrets about the past.
