# karma

In Buddhism, karma refers to the law of cause and effect, where actions and intentions determine the experiences that a person will have in future lives. The following are some of the key attributes of karma in Buddhism:

- Volitional Action: Karma is based on the principle of volitional action, meaning that the intentions and motivations behind an action are key factors in determining its effects.
- Ethical Quality: Karma is closely tied to ethics, as actions that cause harm to others and actions that help others both have consequences in terms of future experiences.
- Interdependent Nature: Karma is seen as interdependent, meaning that all actions and experiences are interconnected and the effects of an action depend on a variety of factors.
- Moment to Moment Experience: The effects of karma are experienced moment to moment, as opposed to being determined by a single action.
- Universal Applicability: Karma is considered to apply to all beings and not just humans, and it is not restricted by time or place.

It is important to note that the understanding of karma can vary between different Buddhist traditions, and that the above attributes are not exhaustive.

## skillful or wholesome action

In Buddhism, actions that lead to positive outcomes, reduce suffering, and promote well-being are considered wholesome or skillful. These actions are known as "kusala" in Pali, one of the ancient languages in which Buddhist texts were written.

Wholesome or skillful actions include acts of generosity, kindness, compassion, wisdom, and ethical conduct. For example, giving to those in need, showing kindness and compassion to others, speaking truthfully and kindly, and cultivating MINDFULNESS and wisdom are all considered wholesome or skillful actions in Buddhism.

On the other hand, actions that lead to negative outcomes, increase suffering, and harm others are considered unwholesome or unskillful. These actions are known as "akusala" in Pali. Examples of unwholesome or unskillful actions include harming others, lying, stealing, engaging in sexual misconduct, and consuming intoxicants.

Buddhism emphasizes the importance of cultivating wholesome or skillful actions, as these actions help to reduce suffering and promote well-being, both for ourselves and for others. By cultivating wholesome actions, we can create positive karmic imprints that will help us to experience more joy, peace, and happiness in this life and in future lives.

## next life

In Buddhism, it is believed that the actions, or karma, that a person performs in this life will determine the nature of their rebirth in the next life. The features that are carried forward to the next life are determined by this karma. This includes the person's mental and emotional tendencies, habits, and propensities, as well as the results of their actions, such as their level of happiness or suffering. The Buddha taught that the ultimate goal is to break free from this cycle of rebirth and attain enlightenment, which involves the cessation of all suffering and the transcendence of all conditioned existence.

## bardo

In Buddhism, bardo refers to the intermediate state between death and rebirth. It is believed that after death, the consciousness of the deceased person goes through a series of transitional experiences in the bardo state, which can last from a few moments up to several weeks. The concept of bardo is an important part of Tibetan Buddhism and is seen as an opportunity for spiritual liberation if one can maintain awareness and mindfulness during this transitional state.

In Buddhism, meditation on the bardo can involve visualizations and contemplations aimed at preparing oneself for the experiences that may arise during the intermediate state between death and rebirth. Here are some general steps for meditating on the bardo:

- Find a quiet and comfortable place where you can sit undisturbed for a period of time.
- Take a few deep breaths and relax your body and mind.
- Visualize yourself surrounded by a protective aura of light, and set the intention to use this meditation to prepare yourself for the bardo.
- Contemplate the impermanence of all things, and the fact that death is an inevitable part of life.
- Visualize the various stages of the bardo and the experiences that may arise, including the peaceful and wrathful deities, and the potential obstacles that may arise.
- As you visualize these stages, cultivate a sense of detachment and equanimity, allowing your mind to remain clear and focused.
- Offer prayers and aspirations for the benefit of all sentient beings, and dedicate the merit of your practice to their liberation.
- Conclude the meditation by taking a few deep breaths and dedicating the merit of your practice to the benefit of all beings.

It's important to note that the practice of bardo meditation can be complex and nuanced, and may vary depending on the specific teachings and traditions one follows. It may be helpful to seek guidance from a qualified teacher if you are interested in pursuing this practice.
