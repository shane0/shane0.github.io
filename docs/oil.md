# oil

## how many years before oil reserves are depleted

The number of years before oil reserves are depleted depends on various factors such as the rate of consumption, discovery of new reserves, advances in technology, and shifts in energy policies. The current estimate for global oil reserves is approximately 1.7 trillion barrels, and the current daily global consumption of oil is about 100 million barrels. Based on these figures, it is estimated that the world's oil reserves will last for about 48.6 years. However, this is a rough estimate and subject to change based on the aforementioned factors.

## how many metric tonnes of co2 will be released by burning the rest of the oil reserves

It is difficult to give a precise estimate of the amount of CO2 that would be released by burning the remaining oil reserves, as it would depend on a number of factors such as the efficiency of extraction and combustion technologies, as well as changes in energy demand over time. However, according to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2014, it is estimated that the burning of all remaining global fossil fuel reserves could release between 2700 and 5000 gigatons of carbon dioxide (GtCO2) into the atmosphere. This would contribute significantly to further climate change and associated impacts.

## how much does the temperature rise from that much co2

The amount that temperature will rise from a given amount of CO2 emissions is a complex and uncertain topic, as it depends on many factors such as the sensitivity of the climate system, feedback mechanisms, and the rate and extent of emissions. However, it is generally agreed that continued high levels of CO2 emissions will contribute to further warming of the planet and other related impacts, such as ocean acidification and sea level rise. The exact amount of warming that will occur from burning the rest of the oil reserves will depend on the amount of oil remaining, as well as the rate and extent of its use.

## what is the rough estimate

The exact temperature rise resulting from a given amount of CO2 emissions is difficult to estimate because it depends on many factors, such as the rate of emissions, the absorption of CO2 by oceans and other carbon sinks, and the feedback loops involved in the climate system. However, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations relative to pre-industrial levels (from about 280 parts per million to about 560 parts per million) is likely to result in a global average temperature increase of 1.5-4.5 degrees Celsius (2.7-8.1 degrees Fahrenheit), with a best estimate of 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit).

## what are the main collapses that occur when the global temperature rises 8.1 degrees

A global temperature rise of 8.1 degrees Celsius would have catastrophic impacts on the Earth's ecosystems and human society. Some of the major collapses that could occur include:

- Melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, leading to a significant rise in sea levels and coastal flooding.
- Collapse of ocean currents, such as the Gulf Stream, which help regulate the climate in many parts of the world.
- Extensive droughts and wildfires, as well as more frequent and intense heatwaves, which would lead to crop failures, water shortages, and widespread ecosystem collapse.
- Acidification of the oceans, which would have devastating impacts on marine ecosystems, including coral reefs and fisheries.
- Release of large amounts of methane from thawing permafrost and melting clathrates, which could trigger even more rapid and severe warming.
- Collapse of many terrestrial ecosystems, such as forests, grasslands, and tundra, which would lead to significant losses in biodiversity and ecosystem services.
