| Dukkha-dukkha  | Physical or mental discomfort, illness, injury, death | This is the suffering or pain that arises from physical or mental discomfort, illness, injury, or death.                                                                                                                                             |
| Samkhara-dukkha | Attachment to conditioned phenomena                 | This is the dukkha that arises from the impermanent and conditioned nature of all things. It includes the suffering that arises from not getting what we want, or getting what we don't want. It arises from our attachment to things that are ultimately unsatisfactory. |
| Viparinama-dukkha | Impermanence and change                              | This is the dukkha that arises from the fact that all things are subject to change and decay, even pleasant experiences. It arises from the impermanent nature of all things, whether we are attached to them or not.                                      |

To clarify, the main difference between Samkhara-dukkha and Viparinama-dukkha is that Samkhara-dukkha refers specifically to the suffering that arises from our attachment to conditioned phenomena, while Viparinama-dukkha refers more broadly to the suffering that arises from the impermanent and changing nature of all things, including our attachment to them.

Conditioned phenomena refer to all things that are dependent upon other causes and conditions for their existence, and are thus impermanent and subject to change. This includes all physical and mental phenomena, including the five aggregates of form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness, as well as all external objects and experiences.

In Buddhism, the concept of conditioned phenomena is closely related to the notion of dependent origination (pratitya-samutpada), which states that all things arise in dependence upon a complex web of causes and conditions, and that there is no permanent, independent self or entity that exists in isolation from this network of interdependence.

| Dependent Origination | The Buddhist doctrine that all phenomena arise in dependence upon other causes and conditions, and that there is no permanent, independent self or entity that exists in isolation from this network of interdependence.                                             |
| Impermanence | The characteristic of all conditioned phenomena that they are subject to change, decay, and dissolution, and that they do not possess any inherent or permanent existence or identity.                                                                     |
| Interdependence | The idea that all phenomena are interconnected and mutually dependent, and that nothing exists in isolation or independently of other factors or conditions.                                                                                                    |
| Five Aggregates | The five components or aspects of experience that constitute the basis of individual existence in Buddhism: form (materiality), feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness.                                                                  |
| External Objects and Experiences | All phenomena and experiences that are not part of one's internal mental or emotional states, but are instead perceived through the senses and interacted with in the external world. This includes all physical objects, events, and activities. |
