## Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche

taught the following steps to help cultivate the experience of non-dual awareness:

- [Calm the mind](shamatha.md): Begin by practicing mindfulness and calm abiding meditation to still the mind and cultivate inner peace.
- [Cultivate insight](vipassana.md): Develop insight into the nature of reality through the study of Buddhist teachings, and through the practice of analytical meditation, which helps to break down our dualistic concepts.
- Cultivate devotion: Cultivate devotion to a teacher, deity, or enlightened being, which helps to create a connection to the non-dual reality and provide a source of inspiration.
- Cultivate the practice of Dzogchen: Practice the teachings of Dzogchen, which are designed to help cultivate non-dual awareness directly.
- Suspend attention: Once the mind is calm and free from dualistic concepts, allow the mind to rest in its natural state of non-dual awareness. This is known as "suspending attention" or "pure awareness."
- Maintain awareness: Maintain awareness in the non-dual state, and gradually integrate this experience into daily life.
- Practice continually: Continuously cultivate this experience through meditation and the integration of the teachings into daily life.

Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche emphasized that this practice requires patience and perseverance.

## Pure awareness

Pure awareness is considered a fundamental aspect of Buddhist teachings and is described as having several attributes. Here are a few of the key attributes of pure awareness:

Clarity: Pure awareness is characterized by its clarity, brightness, and vividness. It is often described as being like a mirror that reflects everything without judgment or distortion.

Openness: Pure awareness is said to be open, spacious, and limitless, transcending all limitations and boundaries.

Non-duality: Pure awareness is non-dual, meaning that it does not discriminate between self and other, subject and object.

Unconditioned: Pure awareness is considered to be unconditioned, meaning that it is free from the influence of thoughts, emotions, and external conditions.

Stability: Pure awareness is stable and unchanging, unaffected by the fluctuations of the mind and external conditions.

Self-sufficient: Pure awareness is said to be self-sufficient, complete, and fulfilling in and of itself, and does not depend on anything else to be realized.

In Buddhist practice, the goal is to cultivate the experience of pure awareness and to integrate this experience into one's daily life. It is considered a key aspect of spiritual development and a direct path to liberation.

## how do you practice dzogchen

Dzogchen (Tibetan: རྫོགས་ཆེན, Wylie: rdzogs chen) is a meditation practice in the Nyingma tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. The goal of Dzogchen is to directly realize the ultimate nature of reality, which is referred to as "rigpa" or "pure awareness".

The instructions for practicing Dzogchen typically involve a series of steps, which can be summarized as follows:

Receiving the transmission and blessings of a qualified teacher: Dzogchen is traditionally taught through a personal transmission from a qualified teacher, who will impart the necessary blessings and guidance for the practice.

Cultivating stability in meditation: It is important to have a solid foundation in meditation, including stable posture, proper breathing, and a relaxed mind.

Recognizing the nature of the mind: The goal of Dzogchen is to directly realize the ultimate nature of reality, which is referred to as rigpa. This requires a shift in perception from ordinary dualistic thinking to an open and spacious awareness.

Resting in the natural state: Once the mind is stabilized in its natural state, the practitioner will simply rest in that state and experience rigpa directly.

Continuing the practice: Dzogchen is a continuous process of resting in rigpa and experiencing its ultimate nature. It is recommended to engage in regular practice and to seek the guidance of a qualified teacher as needed.

It is important to note that Dzogchen is a advanced meditation practice and should only be attempted under the guidance of a qualified teacher. It is not recommended for beginners or those without a solid foundation in meditation.

## what are the attributes of rigpa

Rigpa is a term in Tibetan Buddhism that refers to the ultimate nature of reality, also known as "pure awareness." In the context of Dzogchen meditation, rigpa is considered to be the primordial, pure, and unchanging state of consciousness that is free from dualistic thinking and the conventional understanding of self.

The attributes of rigpa are described in various ways in the teachings of Dzogchen, but some of the most common attributes include:

Clarity: Rigpa is described as being clear, transparent, and free from any mental or emotional agitation.

Openness: Rigpa is said to be open and spacious, allowing for a boundless perspective on reality.

Non-dual: Rigpa is said to be beyond dualistic thinking and beyond the conventional understanding of self and other.

Unobstructed: Rigpa is said to be unobstructed and unaffected by the dualistic distinctions of good and bad, right and wrong, etc.

Self-aware: Rigpa is described as being self-aware, with the ability to know itself without reference to any external objects or thoughts.

Natural: Rigpa is said to be natural, uncontrived, and always present, but obscured by the dualistic thinking and emotional afflictions of the ordinary mind.

These attributes are considered to be the essential qualities of rigpa, which can be directly experienced through the practice of Dzogchen meditation. However, it is important to note that these descriptions of rigpa are meant to be pointers or guides rather than definitive explanations of its nature. The ultimate nature of rigpa can only be directly experienced through practice, and not through conceptual understanding.

## what are the meanings behind the samantabhadra thanka?

The Samantabhadra Thangka is a traditional Tibetan Buddhist painting that depicts the bodhisattva Samantabhadra, who is associated with universal compassion and the practice of meditation. Thangkas are used as a visual aid for meditation and as a tool for transmitting spiritual teachings.

The imagery and symbolism in the thangka are rich with meaning and are meant to convey important teachings and spiritual messages to the viewer.

For example, the white elephant that Samantabhadra is often depicted riding symbolizes the pure, unstained nature of the mind and the ability to rise above ignorance and delusion. The sun and moon behind Samantabhadra's head symbolize the illuminating and all-encompassing nature of wisdom. The aura of light that surrounds Samantabhadra represents the radiance of compassion and the transforming power of bodhicitta, the mind of enlightenment.

The Samantabhadra Thangka can also be interpreted as a visual representation of the ultimate nature of reality. The central figure of Samantabhadra is often surrounded by other buddhas and bodhisattvas, which represents the interdependent nature of all things and the idea that all beings are ultimately interconnected.

Overall, the meanings behind the Samantabhadra Thangka are meant to evoke a sense of reverence, inspiration, and motivation for spiritual practice.

## what type of meditation uses emptiness?

In Buddhism, meditation on emptiness (also called "shunyata" or "the emptiness of self") is a central practice in some schools, especially the Mahayana tradition. This type of meditation involves contemplating the nature of reality and our own perception of it, with the goal of understanding the concept of emptiness. Emptiness meditation is often used as a means of reducing attachment and achieving liberation from suffering.

The exact methods of emptiness meditation can vary depending on the specific tradition, but some common practices include analytical meditation, in which one reflects on the emptiness of all phenomena, and calm abiding meditation, in which one maintains a stable and focused mind. In both cases, the goal is to develop insight into the ultimate nature of reality and the interdependence of all phenomena.

It's important to approach emptiness meditation with the guidance of a qualified teacher and to maintain a strong foundation in ethics and mindfulness practices, as this type of meditation can be challenging and may require a certain level of maturity and understanding.
