# emptiness & impermanence

## what is Upajjhaṭṭhana

Upajjhaṭṭhana is a Pali word that means "the four reminders." In Theravada Buddhism, Upajjhaṭṭhana is a practice of self-reflection and mindfulness that is used to cultivate a sense of awareness and understanding. It is one of the Five Spiritual Faculties, along with faith, effort, mindfulness, and concentration.

The four reminders of Upajjhaṭṭhana are:

Impermanence (Anicca): Everything is constantly changing and nothing lasts forever.

Suffering (Dukkha): All existence is characterized by suffering and unsatisfactoriness.

Non-self (Anatta): The self is not a permanent, unchanging entity but is instead a collection of ever-changing mental and physical phenomena.

The Four Noble Truths: The teachings of the Buddha about the nature of suffering and the path to liberation from it.

By contemplating these four reminders, practitioners of Upajjhaṭṭhana aim to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of reality and the causes of suffering, and to develop greater wisdom, compassion, and liberation from negative mental states and suffering. The practice can be performed alone or as part of a group, and can be a helpful tool for gaining greater insight and clarity in one's daily life.
