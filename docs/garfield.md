# jay garfield

- this is a perfect example of the [feynman technique](feynman.md)
- jay clearly has a very deep understanding of buddhism and non duality
- I recommend his videos and book "losing ourselves"
- this video speaks volumes, it summarizes the essence of all of the content here
- of all the content I've been exposed to on meditation jay explains it better than chat gpt or any human I've heard teach
- chat gpt has no conent for jay, I'm sending feedback on that

## extinguising illusions

- the confusion is something that appears one way and exists in another

### root cause

- it is not non existent
- it's mode of existence vs mode of appearance
- immediate condition: attraction & aversion
- root cause is confusion about the nature of reality

### profound confusion on the nature of reality

- first aspect
  - that we can be aware of the contents of our own mind
- second aspect
  - superimposition of a subject object duality on the primordially non dual

### types of confusions

- [impermanent](impermenence.md) & permanent
- conventionally real & [ultimately real](emptiness.md)
- source of [happiness](hapiness.md) & source of suffering
- independent & [interdependent](interdependence.md)
