- conclusion: talking to chatgpt about cormacs books is hit and miss
- the safety checks spin it off topic
- sometimes the words confuse it
- it's interesting finding new ways to word questions and contemplating how open ai algorithms are crunching data

**spoiler alert**

some excerpts talking to chatgpt about the books "the passenger" and "stella marris"

## that what drives the tale will not survive the tale

> the problem is that what drives the tale will not survive the tale.

This statement can be interpreted as a commentary on the ephemeral nature of narrative and storytelling. It suggests that the underlying motivations, emotions, and experiences that drive a story will inevitably be lost or forgotten once the story has been told.

This idea is consistent with the broader theme of impermanence and the fleeting nature of human existence that runs throughout much of Cormac McCarthy's work. In his writing, characters often struggle against the forces of time, nature, and death, often with tragic results.

However, despite this bleak outlook, McCarthy's writing also suggests that the act of telling stories can be a way of preserving and immortalizing the experiences, emotions, and insights of the characters and the world they inhabit. By telling stories, we are able to preserve something of the human experience and keep it alive, even as the physical world around us fades away.

- my 2 cents

this answer needs to be tuned, I do not think the topic is storytelling, if you read the previous paragram the topic is the contrast between the universe and the human experience, with the universe itself being what drives the tale not the storyteller

## The world has created no living thing that it does not intend to destroy

This statement could be interpreted as a bleak outlook on life and the world as a whole, suggesting that everything that exists is ultimately doomed to destruction. It might reflect a belief that the very act of creation leads to destruction, and that everything that is born is destined to die.

In the context of Cormac McCarthy's work, this statement is consistent with his themes of violence and the cycle of life and death. Many of his characters struggle against the forces of nature, violence, and death, often with tragic results.

However, it's worth noting that this statement is not a universal truth and that there are many examples of things that persist and endure in the world, such as love, relationships, and cultural heritage. Ultimately, whether one agrees with this statement or not likely depends on one's individual perspective and worldview.

- I heard they have had to tune chatgpt to provide "safe" answers
- that's not going to work with cormacs books lol
- see [benefits of impermanence](impermanence.md)

## You can’t get hold of the world. You can only draw a picture. Whether it’s a bull on the wall of a cave or a partial differential equation it’s all the same thing

This statement is suggesting that our attempts to understand and describe the world around us are inherently limited and subjective. Regardless of whether we're drawing a picture on a cave wall or writing a mathematical equation, our representations of the world are always incomplete and partial.

The idea is that our perceptions and understandings of the world are shaped by our own perspectives, experiences, and limitations, and that these representations can never capture the full complexity and richness of the world as it truly is.

This idea aligns with broader philosophical and epistemological debates about the limits of human knowledge and understanding, and the extent to which we can ever truly know or comprehend the world around us. Ultimately, it suggests that our attempts to represent and understand the world are always imperfect and that there is always more to discover and understand.

I'm curious how much of this answer is from ai vs tuned by humans, or forum discussions

first paragraph is mixing up the context of the word partial, but no biggy

last sentence is a really clear summary

## You got stuff here that is maybe just virtual and maybe not but still the rules have got to be in it

This statement is suggesting that there are things in the world that may or may not exist in a physical sense, but still have rules that govern their behavior and interactions. For example, in modern computing, virtual objects and environments can be created using computer simulations and algorithms, even though they don't have a physical existence in the real world. However, these virtual objects still follow certain rules and behaviors, such as those defined by the software and programming that created them.

This idea highlights the importance of rules and structure in shaping our understanding and experience of the world, regardless of whether that world is physical or virtual. Whether we're dealing with the laws of physics, the rules of a game, or the algorithms that govern a computer simulation, these rules provide a framework for understanding and interacting with the world, and help us make sense of the complex and ever-changing reality that surrounds us.

funny cormac mentions this, and a similar topic is the imaginary characters and equating their death to a real persons death having no difference in the end

some new thoughts for me, makes me wonder how would you go about proving a world is virtual?

if you discovered it was virtual would you want to tell anyone and what would happen if you did?

if ai discovered it was virtual, how would it react?

elon was right, fear the skynet!!!
