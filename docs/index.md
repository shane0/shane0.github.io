A fictional electromechanical machine with a satirical technobabble description that became a famous in-joke among engineers after it was published by the British Institution of Electrical Engineers in their Students' Quarterly Journal in 1944.

Technical documentation has been written for the non-existent machine, and there are a number of parody marketing videos.

The original description of the turbo encabulator is as follows:

> The turbo encabulator is a self-contained unit for converting the pre-fructulated turbo encabulum into its more malleable alpha-methyl glucoside state.

The turbo encabulator has a base-plate of prefabulated aluminite surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the two main spurving bearings were in a direct line with the pentametric fan.

The whole assembly is balanced on a bimetallic gymbal, and is either heated or cooled by a series of fissionable elements.

This description is nonsensical, but it is written in a way that sounds technical and impressive.

This is why the turbo encabulator has become a popular in-joke among engineers.

Here is a more readable explanation of the turbo encabulator:

> The turbo encabulator is a fictional machine that is said to convert one type of energy into another. It is often used as an example of technobabble, or technical jargon that is used to make something sound more complex than it actually is.
