## Four Noble Truths

- **Dukkha** (दुःख), which means suffering, unsatisfactoriness, or pain.
- **Samudaya** (समुदाय), which means arising or origination.
- **Nirodha** (निरोध), which means cessation or stopping.
- **Marga** (मार्ग), which means path or way.

- The Four Noble Truths are the central doctrine of Buddhism.
- They provide a framework for understanding the nature of suffering and how to achieve liberation from it.
- The first truth, dukkha, is the recognition that all life is characterized by suffering.
- This suffering can take many forms, including physical pain, emotional pain, and mental pain.
- The second truth, samudaya, is the understanding that suffering arises from craving.
- Craving is the desire for things that are impermanent, unsatisfying, and ultimately unattainable.
- The third truth, nirodha, is the realization that suffering can be ended.
- This can be done by eliminating craving and attachment.
- The fourth truth, marga, is the path to the cessation of suffering. This path is known as the Noble Eightfold Path.

The Four Noble Truths are a profound and complex teaching. They offer a way to understand the nature of reality and to find liberation from suffering.
