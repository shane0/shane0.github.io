Metta meditation, also known as loving-kindness meditation, is a type of meditation practiced in Buddhism to cultivate feelings of friendliness, kindness, and compassion towards oneself and others.

Here are some steps for practicing metta meditation:

- Find a quiet place to sit comfortably, with a straight back and relaxed posture.
- Focus on your breath, taking deep breaths in and out.
- Repeat the following phrases silently to yourself, starting with yourself: "May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be safe. May I live with ease."
- Expand your focus to loved ones and close friends, repeating the phrases for each person: "May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be safe. May you live with ease."
- Next, extend your thoughts of kindness and compassion to neutral people in your life, such as acquaintances or coworkers.
- Finally, focus on difficult people or those with whom you have conflict, repeating the phrases for them: "May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be safe. May you live with ease."
- If your mind becomes distracted, gently bring it back to the phrases and focus on the feelings of kindness and compassion you are trying to cultivate.

When you are finished, sit quietly for a few moments, allowing the feelings of love and compassion to permeate your being.
