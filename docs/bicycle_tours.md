## pacific coast

## iron horse trail

- I rode this in 2021 with Fernando
- the iron horse was originally a railroad
- this trail is cool becaause after you get to snoqualmie its all downhill to the columbia river!
- also there is a 2 mile! tunnel under snoqualmie pass
- this railroad originaly went here to chicago & became a highway
- now the bridge over the columbia river is open and the trail continues!
- I hope to do the entire rail to trail which I think goes to chicago like the original train

## ragbrai

- every year in iowa people create bicycle tour routes across iowa
- ragbrai = registers (newspaper) great bike ride across iowa
- I think around 8000 people do this each year
- they have a truck transport your camping gear
- roads get closed & campgrounds are setup
- I was able to ride this in 2010
- I did this self supported & i rode out & back from iowa city
