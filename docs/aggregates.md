# aggregates

- 5 heaps or aggregates
- like baggage everyone carries around on their shoulders
- like the [6 senses](sense.md) if you take one of these away the person exists
- therefore no self is found in any individual aggregate
- you are not your body, feelings, perceptions, mental formations or consciousness
- these all [arise from interdependent causes](interdependence.md) and pass away

## what is khanda sutta

The Khandha Sutta is a discourse from the Pali Canon of Theravada Buddhism. The word "khandha" in Pali refers to the five aggregates of physical and mental phenomena that make up the concept of an individual self.

The five aggregates are:

- form (body)
- feelings
- perceptions
- mental formations
- consciousness

In the Khandha Sutta, the Buddha teaches about the nature of the five aggregates and their interdependence. He explains that these aggregates are not a permanent, unchanging self, but are instead impermanent and constantly changing phenomena that arise and pass away in response to different conditions.

The Khandha Sutta is often used as a teaching tool to help practitioners understand the nature of self and reality. By examining the five aggregates, practitioners can gain insight into the impermanence and lack of self in all things and develop a more profound understanding of dependent origination, the idea that all phenomena arise in dependence upon other phenomena.

Through this insight, practitioners can overcome attachment and ignorance, and eventually attain liberation from the cycle of birth and death. The Khandha Sutta is an important text in Theravada Buddhism and is widely studied by practitioners seeking to deepen their understanding of Buddhist teachings.
