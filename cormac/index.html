<p>this is consistent with the broader theme of <abbr title="Anicca, or impermanence, is a central concept in Buddhism that refers to the ever-changing and transient nature of all phenomena. According to the Buddhist understanding, nothing in the world remains the same from one moment to the next, and everything is subject to constant transformation and decay. This includes not only physical objects but also thoughts, emotions, and experiences. By recognizing the impermanent nature of all things, Buddhists aim to develop a deeper understanding of the world and to cultivate a greater sense of detachment, wisdom, and compassion.">IMPERMANENCE</abbr> and the fleeting nature of the universe and human existence that runs throughout much of cormac mccarthy's work</p>

<h3 id="destruction">destruction</h3>

<p class="admonition-title">The world has created no living thing that it does not intend to destroy</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>see <a href="../buddhism/impermenence/">benefits of impermanence</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This statement could be interpreted as a bleak outlook on life and the world as a whole, suggesting that everything that exists is ultimately doomed to destruction. It might reflect a belief that the very act of creation leads to destruction, and that everything that is born is destined to die.</p>
<p>In the context of Cormac McCarthy's work, this statement is consistent with his themes of violence and the cycle of life and death. Many of his characters struggle against the forces of nature, violence, and death, often with tragic results.</p>
<p>However, it's worth noting that this statement is not a universal truth and that there are many examples of things that persist and endure in the world, such as love, relationships, and cultural heritage. Ultimately, whether one agrees with this statement or not likely depends on one's individual perspective and worldview.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">You can’t get hold of the world. You can only draw a picture. Whether it’s a bull on the wall of a cave or a partial differential equation it’s all the same thing</p>
</div>
<p>This idea aligns with broader philosophical and epistemological debates about the limits of human knowledge and understanding, and the extent to which we can ever truly know or comprehend the world around us. Ultimately, it suggests that our attempts to represent and understand the world are always imperfect and that there is always more to discover and understand.</p>
<h3 id="nature-of-reality">nature of reality</h3>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">You got stuff here that is maybe just virtual and maybe not but still the rules have got to be in it</p>
</div>
<p>This statement is suggesting that there are things in the world that may or may not exist in a physical sense, but still have rules that govern their behavior and interactions. For example, in modern computing, virtual objects and environments can be created using computer simulations and algorithms, even though they don't have a physical existence in the real world. However, these virtual objects still follow certain rules and behaviors, such as those defined by the software and programming that created them.</p>
<p>This idea highlights the importance of rules and structure in shaping our understanding and experience of the world, regardless of whether that world is physical or virtual. Whether we're dealing with the laws of physics, the rules of a game, or the algorithms that govern a computer simulation, these rules provide a framework for understanding and interacting with the world, and help us make sense of the complex and ever-changing reality that surrounds us.</p>
