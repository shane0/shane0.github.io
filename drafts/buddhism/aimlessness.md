Thich Nhat Hanh, the Vietnamese Zen Master and teacher, often emphasizes the importance of aimlessness or non-striving in the practice of MINDFULNESS and meditation. He argues that we often have a tendency to constantly strive for something, whether it be material possessions or a certain state of mind. This striving can lead to stress, anxiety, and dissatisfaction.

In his teachings, Thich Nhat Hanh encourages individuals to cultivate a state of aimlessness, where they can let go of their desires and just be in the present moment. He explains that when we let go of our goals and desires, we can experience true peace and happiness. In this state of aimlessness, we can simply be present and enjoy each moment as it unfolds, without being attached to outcomes or results.

In his book, "The Sun My Heart," Thich Nhat Hanh writes: "The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When MINDFULNESS embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers." This highlights the importance of being present and aimless in our relationships with others and the world around us.
