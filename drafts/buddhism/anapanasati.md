Find a quiet place to sit: Find a quiet, comfortable place to sit where you will not be disturbed. You can sit in a chair, on a cushion, or on a meditation bench. Maintain good posture and keep your back straight.

Focus on the breath: Close your eyes and focus your attention on the sensation of the breath as it enters and leaves your nostrils. Pay close attention to the sensation of the breath and the rise and fall of your chest.

Follow the breath: As you focus on the breath, allow your mind to follow it. Do not try to control your breath or change its natural rhythm. If your mind begins to wander, gently bring it back to the breath.

Expand your awareness: As you become more relaxed and focused, begin to expand your awareness to include the sensations in your body. Pay attention to any areas of tightness, tension, or discomfort and try to let go of these sensations as you inhale and exhale.

Cultivate mindfulness: Continuously cultivate MINDFULNESS of the breath, body sensations, and mental states. Observe your thoughts and emotions with equanimity and detachment.

Develop concentration: Over time, try to maintain your focus on the breath for longer and longer periods of time. As your CONCENTRATION improves, you may experience deeper states of peace and tranquility.

Integrate meditation into daily life: As you progress in your meditation practice, try to integrate the awareness and MINDFULNESS developed in meditation into your daily life. Apply the principles of Anapanasati meditation to your thoughts, emotions, and actions throughout the day.

These are general instructions for Anapanasati meditation in the Theravada tradition. It's important to find a teacher or meditation center that you trust and to develop a regular practice in order to get the most benefit from the practice.
