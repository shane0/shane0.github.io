- I had a great childhood that I think shaped my view of the world more than anything
- that is probably why I'm obsessed with hiking and bicycle tours
- we used to walk up the creeks to find their source point finding creatures along the way
- I went to Franklin elementry school in Iowa and it was also a nuclear bomb shelter
- that and the way we live as if we are not part of the ecosystem baffled me until I found these videos
- now I see this nonsense is not new and should not be surprising
- we fail to learn this lesson from history
- a more intelligent species would adapt and avoid these problems like collapse from complexity and ecological overshoot
