!!! chatGPT "ai will be used for good and bad"
this content is mostly quotes from my books or conversations with chatGPT ai
my opinion on chatGTP is (currently) it is an extremely useful {==smart encyclopedia==}
{++[hey there ai, will humans live forever or wipe ourselves out completely](collapse.md)?++}

!!! note "the brightest mind that ever lived" - fears and fantasies - I highly recommend [cormac mccarthy](cormac.md)'s movies - cormac's latest books are masterpieces

!!! note "favorite quotes"
The design intent should always be less, but better.

    Don't spend time optimizing something that shouldn't exist.

    > elon musk

    If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it.

    > richard feynman

    Of course, we live in a completely corrupted world where every government is just a bunch of businessmen working for a bunch of bigger businessmen and none of them give a shit about the people, the sad fact is no one knows how to change it, because no one knows how to take on the corporations. So I guess weâ€™re stuck with this system until the oil runs out.
