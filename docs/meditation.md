### 4 noble truths

### heart sutra

```text
Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva, while practicing the profound prajnaparamita,
Caught sight of the emptiness of all five skandhas,
And thereby freed himself from all suffering and evil.

Here, Shariputra, form is emptiness, emptiness is form.
Form is not other than emptiness, emptiness is not other than form.
That which is form is emptiness, that which is emptiness is form.
The same is true of feeling, thought, karmic formations, and consciousness.

Shariputra, all dharmas are marked with emptiness;
They do not come into being or pass away,
They are not defiled or pure,
They do not increase or decrease.

Therefore, in emptiness, there is no form,
No feeling, no thought, no karmic formations,
No consciousness;
No eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind;
No sights, no sounds, no smells, no tastes, no touchables, no objects of mind;
No realm of eyes up to no realm of mind consciousness;
No ignorance, no extinction of ignorance,
Up to no old age and death, and no extinction of old age and death;
No suffering, no cause of suffering, no end of suffering,
No path, no no-path.

There is no wisdom and no attainment.
Because there is nothing to attain,
The bodhisattva, through relying on prajnaparamita,
Has no obscurations of mind,
No fear,
Gone beyond all ills,
Able to attain nirvana.
All buddhas of past, present, and future
Achieved enlightenment through relying on prajnaparamita.

Therefore, know the prajnaparamita as the great mantra,
The mantra of great wisdom,
The highest mantra,
The unequalled mantra,
The mantra that calms all suffering;
True, not false.
Therefore, proclaim the prajnaparamita mantra:
Gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha.
```

- "apana" (अपान) means "out-breath"
- "sati" (सति) means "mindfulness" or "awareness"

| Anicca                             | Refers to the idea that all things are constantly changing and in a state of flux. Nothing in the world is permanent, and everything is subject to birth, aging, sickness, and death.                                                                                                                                              |
| Dukkha                             | Refers to the idea that all things in the world are inherently unsatisfactory and cannot provide lasting happiness or fulfillment. This suffering is caused by our attachment to impermanent things and our ignorance of the true nature of reality.                                                                               |
| Anatta                             | Refers to the idea that there is no fixed or permanent self or soul. Rather, our sense of self is an ever-changing product of our thoughts, emotions, and experiences. The concept of anatta is closely related to the idea of emptiness (shunyata), which is the ultimate nature of all phenomena according to Mahayana Buddhism. |
