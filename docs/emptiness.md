## Emptiness, or "shunyata"

Emptiness, or "shunyata" in Sanskrit, is a central teaching in Buddhism, particularly in the Mahayana tradition. It refers to the nature of all phenomena as being devoid of inherent existence.

Here are some of the key attributes of emptiness in Buddhism:

- [Interdependent](interdependence.md) origination: All phenomena arise in dependence upon other causes and conditions, and are therefore not independently existent.
- Impermanence: All phenomena are subject to change and are therefore inherently unsatisfactory.
- Lack of self-nature: The idea that all things, including the self, lack a permanent, unchanging essence.
- Emptiness of phenomena: All phenomena are empty of an inherent existence and are merely the coming together of various causes and conditions.
- Emptiness of the self: The self is empty of an inherent existence and is merely a collection of five aggregates â€“ form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness.
- The two truths: The teaching of the two truths, relative and ultimate, helps to explain the relationship between the emptiness of all phenomena and the conventional reality of our everyday experience.
- Liberation: Through the understanding of emptiness, one can achieve liberation from suffering and attain the state of enlightenment.

Emptiness is a profound and complex teaching that can be difficult to understand. However, it is considered a crucial aspect of Buddhist philosophy and is seen as a key to realizing the ultimate nature of reality.
