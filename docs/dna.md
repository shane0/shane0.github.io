# DNA

DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is a long, complex molecule found in nearly all living organisms that contains genetic instructions used in the development and function of living organisms. It is composed of four basic building blocks called nucleotides (adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine) arranged in a specific sequence, which determines the genetic information that an organism inherits and passes down to its offspring. DNA is located in the nucleus of cells in the form of chromosomes and can be replicated and passed on to new cells during cell division.```

It is estimated that about {++8% of human DNA actually originated from viruses that infected our ancestors millions of years ago++}.

## ancestors and inbreds

a person living today likely had around 2^40 ancestors, or approximately 1 trillion, ancestors 1,000 years ago. This estimate assumes that there is no interbreeding between ancestors, which is not always the case.

some genetic studies have suggested that all humans are at least 50th cousins, and possibly as closely related as 20th cousins. The degree of cousinship between two individuals depends on how recently they share a common ancestor. As humans have interbred and migrated throughout history, it is likely that we all share common ancestors at some point in the past.

## possible humans

The total possible combinations of human DNA can be calculated using the formula 4^n, where n is the number of base pairs in the DNA sequence. The human genome contains approximately 3 billion base pairs, so the total possible combinations of human DNA can be estimated as:

4^3,000,000,000 = approximately 1.07 x 10^1,800,000,000

This number is so large that it is difficult to comprehend. It is estimated that there are only about 10^80 atoms in the observable universe, which is many orders of magnitude smaller than the number of possible combinations of human DNA. This highlights the incredible diversity and complexity of the genetic code, and the immense potential for variation within the human species.

## total expressions

it is thought that the total number of humans who have ever lived is somewhere between 100 billion and 120 billion

it's estimated that the human genome has undergone many changes over the course of evolution, with an estimated 99.9% similarity between all humans. This suggests that a large portion of possible DNA expressions have occurred since the beginning of mankind.

It is estimated that approximately 108 billion humans have lived on Earth since the emergence of Homo sapiens about 300,000 years ago. The total number of possible unique DNA combinations in humans is estimated to be around 10^37.

Assuming each human individual had a unique DNA combination, the percentage of possible human DNA combinations that have occurred since the beginning of mankind would be 1 / 10^37 \* 10^11, which is an extremely small number, essentially approaching zero. However, it's important to note that there is significant overlap in DNA between individuals, so the actual number of unique DNA combinations is much smaller than the theoretical maximum.
