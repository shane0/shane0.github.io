# Reductionism Approach

in Problem Solving:

1. Define the problem and identify the main goal.
2. Break down the problem into smaller and simpler parts.
3. Identify the cause-effect relationships between these parts.
4. Analyze each part in detail and identify the underlying mechanisms.
5. Use this knowledge to understand how the parts fit together and how they contribute to the whole.
6. Test each part and refine the understanding of the cause-effect relationships.
7. Integrate the knowledge of each part to create a comprehensive understanding of the problem.
8. Develop a solution based on this understanding, and test it to ensure it solves the problem.

Example:

Problem: A car won't start.

1. Define the problem and identify the main goal: To get the car to start.
2. Break down the problem into smaller and simpler parts: Fuel system, ignition system, battery, starter motor.
3. Identify the cause-effect relationships between these parts: No fuel or spark will prevent the engine from starting. The battery supplies power to the starter motor, which cranks the engine.
4. Analyze each part in detail and identify the underlying mechanisms: Fuel pump, fuel filter, fuel injectors, spark plugs, ignition coils, battery terminals, starter motor solenoid.
5. Use this knowledge to understand how the parts fit together and how they contribute to the whole: The fuel pump delivers fuel to the injectors, which spray fuel into the engine cylinders. The spark plugs ignite the fuel to start the engine. The battery supplies power to the ignition coils and starter motor.
6. Test each part and refine the understanding of the cause-effect relationships: Use a fuel pressure gauge to check fuel pressure. Use a spark tester to check for spark. Use a voltmeter to check battery voltage and starter motor current draw.
7. Integrate the knowledge of each part to create a comprehensive understanding of the problem: A lack of fuel pressure may indicate a faulty fuel pump, fuel filter, or fuel injectors. A lack of spark may indicate a faulty spark plug or ignition coil. Low battery voltage or high starter motor current draw may indicate a faulty battery or starter motor.
8. Develop a solution based on this understanding, and test it to ensure it solves the problem: Replace faulty components and test the system until the car starts.
