`Lao Tzu said:`

:   - If you are depressed you are living in the past.
    - If you are anxious you are living in the future.
    - If you are at peace you are living in the present.

    The design intent should always be less, but better.

    Don't spend time optimizing something that shouldn't exist.

    If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it.

    > richard feynman

    Of course, we live in a completely corrupted world where every government is just a bunch of businessmen working for a bunch of bigger businessmen and none of them give a shit about the people, the sad fact is no one knows how to change it, because no one knows how to take on the corporations. So I guess weâ€™re stuck with this system until the oil runs out.
