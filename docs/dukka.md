## two forms of suffering

In Tibetan Buddhism, Mingyur Rinpoche teaches that there are two forms of suffering: ordinary suffering and ultimate suffering.

1. Ordinary suffering: This refers to the physical and mental pain that we experience in our daily lives, such as physical pain, illness, emotional distress, and so on.
1. Ultimate suffering: This refers to the underlying root cause of all our suffering, which is ignorance and the delusion of self. According to Mingyur Rinpoche, it is this fundamental ignorance that creates the illusion of a separate self and leads to the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, or samsara.

By recognizing and overcoming the root cause of ultimate suffering, one can attain liberation and ultimate happiness, which is referred to as enlightenment. Mingyur Rinpoche teaches that this can be achieved through the practice of meditation and the development of wisdom and compassion.

## two fold ignorance

In Tibetan Buddhism, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche taught about two types of ignorance that obscure our true nature and prevent us from realizing our full potential. These are:

1. Conceptual ignorance: This refers to our misunderstanding of the nature of reality, due to our clinging to dualistic concepts such as self and other, and our inability to see the interdependence and impermanence of all things. This type of ignorance creates a false duality and leads to suffering.
1. Non-conceptual ignorance: This refers to the innate or unconscious ignorance that lies at the root of our suffering. It is a deep-seated belief in a solid, unchanging self that is separate from the rest of the world. This type of ignorance is more difficult to recognize and overcome, as it is not based on thoughts or concepts, but rather on a deep-seated habit of mind.

Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche taught that through the practice of meditation and the development of wisdom and compassion, we can gradually overcome these two forms of ignorance and come to realize our true nature as pure and unchanging awareness. By doing so, we can achieve lasting peace and happiness, and escape the cycle of birth and death.
