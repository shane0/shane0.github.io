## language barriers

There are many reasons why humans create language barriers, including:

- Fear of the unknown: People may feel threatened by others who speak a different language, and create barriers to protect themselves.
- Nationalism: People may feel a strong attachment to their own language and culture, and view other languages as inferior.
- Lack of education: People who are not educated may have a limited understanding of other languages and cultures, and may create barriers as a result.
- Historical conflict: Past conflicts between different groups may have led to language barriers being created as a way to maintain separation and preserve cultural identity.
- Economic competition: Language barriers can arise as a result of competition between different groups for economic resources and opportunities.
- Stereotyping: People may have preconceived notions about other cultures and languages, and use these stereotypes to justify language barriers.

Overall, language barriers are often a result of a combination of these factors, and can have negative effects on communication, understanding, and cooperation between different groups.

> common languages

Ethnologue, a widely-used reference for language information, currently lists over 7,000 living languages, while other estimates suggest there may be up to 8,000 or more. However, many of these languages are endangered or have only a small number of speakers.

The majority of computer programming languages use only English.

To make computer software thousands of programming languages are used, they all do the same thing, manipulate content stored on drives in folders and files, some formats are human readable some are only for a machine to read.

Ai is going to translate these thousands into one integrated language that is human readable, but it will aslo create faster and more efficient programming languages that will replace the ones humans created and we will not understand how they work, we  will only observe the results and retrain.

## active voice

Active voice is a grammatical construction in which the subject of a sentence performs the action of the verb. In other words, the focus is on the agent or doer of the action. The active voice is formed by placing the subject before the verb, followed by the object or complement. For example, "John kicked the ball" is in the active voice, whereas "The ball was kicked by John" is in the passive voice. The use of active voice is generally preferred in academic writing because it makes the writing more direct, clear, and concise. It can also make the writing more engaging and persuasive, as it highlights the responsibility of the agent for the action.

## passive voice

Passive voice is a grammatical construction in which the subject of a sentence appears to undergo an action rather than performing it. In passive voice, the focus is on the action itself, rather than the agent performing the action. The passive voice is formed using a form of the auxiliary verb "to be" followed by the past participle of the main verb. For example, "The ball was kicked by John" is in the passive voice, whereas "John kicked the ball" is in the active voice. The use of passive voice is often discouraged in academic writing because it can obscure the agent responsible for the action and make the writing less clear. However, in some cases, such as when the agent is unknown or unimportant, passive voice may be more appropriate.
