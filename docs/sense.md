## how do you meditate using the 6 sextets

The "6 Rupa Sextets" or the "6 Sense Bases" is a meditation technique mentioned in the Buddhist scriptures that provides a framework for contemplating the nature of experience. The six sextets are:

1. Eye and visible forms
1. Ear and sounds
1. Nose and odours
1. Tongue and tastes
1. Body and tactile sensations
1. Mind and mental objects
1. To meditate using the 6 sextets, you can follow these steps:

Find a quiet place to sit, where you will not be disturbed.

Start by focusing your mind on your breath, letting go of any thoughts or distractions.

Begin to contemplate each of the six sextets, one by one.

Start with the first sextet, the eye and visible forms, and consider how these things arise and pass away in your experience.

Move on to the next sextet, ear and sounds, and similarly contemplate how these things arise and pass away in your experience.

Repeat this process with each of the remaining sextets, contemplating how each one arises and passes away in your experience.

Continue this contemplation, until you reach a state of insight and understanding of the impermanence and insubstantial nature of all things.

It is important to approach this meditation with an open and non-judgmental mind, allowing yourself to simply observe and contemplate without clinging or resisting what arises.

## what is chachakka sutta

The Chachakka Sutta (also known as the "Eighteen Reasons" or "Eighteen Cesses") is a Buddhist discourse that appears in the Majjhima Nikaya, one of the early Buddhist scriptures. The Chachakka Sutta outlines the "Eighteen Cesses" or reasons for why the conditioned things in the world are impermanent and not self.

The Eighteen Cesses describe the process of dependent origination (Paticca Samuppada), which is one of the central teachings in Buddhism. According to this teaching, all phenomena arise in dependence upon causes and conditions, and therefore have no permanent essence or self.

The Eighteen Cesses are divided into twelve Nidanas, which describe the twelve links in the chain of dependent origination, and six interdependent factors that arise as a result of the twelve Nidanas. By reflecting on these eighteen reasons, practitioners can gain insight into the impermanence of all things and the non-existence of an unchanging self.

The Chachakka Sutta is widely studied and recited within the Theravada tradition, and is considered an important teaching for gaining a deeper understanding of the nature of reality and the causes of suffering.

## Sadayatana

Sadayatana is a term in Buddhism that refers to the six sense organs and their corresponding objects, which include the eye and visible objects, the ear and sounds, the nose and smells, the tongue and tastes, the body and tangible objects, and the mind and mental objects. These six internal and external factors interact with one another and contribute to the creation of our perceptions and experiences. Understanding the nature of these interactions is an important aspect of Buddhist meditation and liberation.
