# emptiness & impermanence

## what is Upajjhaṭṭhana

Upajjhaṭṭhana is a Pali word that means "the four reminders." In Theravada Buddhism, Upajjhaṭṭhana is a practice of self-reflection and mindfulness that is used to cultivate a sense of awareness and understanding. It is one of the Five Spiritual Faculties, along with faith, effort, mindfulness, and concentration.

The four reminders of Upajjhaṭṭhana are:

Impermanence (Anicca): Everything is constantly changing and nothing lasts forever.

Suffering (Dukkha): All existence is characterized by suffering and unsatisfactoriness.

Non-self (Anatta): The self is not a permanent, unchanging entity but is instead a collection of ever-changing mental and physical phenomena.

The Four Noble Truths: The teachings of the Buddha about the nature of suffering and the path to liberation from it.

By contemplating these four reminders, practitioners of Upajjhaṭṭhana aim to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of reality and the causes of suffering, and to develop greater wisdom, compassion, and liberation from negative mental states and suffering. The practice can be performed alone or as part of a group, and can be a helpful tool for gaining greater insight and clarity in one's daily life.

## impermenence

Meditation on impermanence is a common practice in Buddhism, where it is recognized as one of the Three Universal Truths along with suffering and non-self. This type of meditation involves reflecting on the transience and fleeting nature of all things, including our own bodies, thoughts, and emotions.

The goal of meditation on impermanence is to cultivate a sense of detachment and to overcome attachment to the material world. By understanding that everything is impermanent and constantly changing, practitioners aim to develop a greater appreciation for the present moment and to reduce feelings of fear and anxiety about the future.

One common method of impermanence meditation is to reflect on the different stages of life, such as birth, aging, illness, and death. Practitioners may also focus on the impermanence of physical objects and the changing nature of their thoughts and emotions.

As with other types of meditation, it's important to approach meditation on impermanence with the guidance of a qualified teacher and to maintain a strong foundation in ethics and mindfulness practices.
