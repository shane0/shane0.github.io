    title User Journey for Eco Collapse

    section Causes
        Start --> |Climate Change| Extreme weather events
        Extreme weather events --> |Damage| Infrastructure & Property Loss
        Infrastructure & Property Loss --> |Economic burden| Financial Crisis
        Financial Crisis --> |Austerity measures| Reduced Government support
        Reduced Government support --> |Lack of preparedness| Poor Response to crisis
        Poor Response to crisis --> |Ecosystem degradation| Habitat loss and Wildlife extinction
        Ecosystem degradation --> |Food scarcity| Hunger and malnutrition
        Hunger and malnutrition --> |Disease outbreak| Public Health Crisis

    section Effects
        Climate Change --> |Rising temperatures| Heat waves and Droughts
        Heat waves and Droughts --> |Water scarcity| Reduced access to water
        Reduced access to water --> |Food insecurity| Crop failure and Price spikes
        Crop failure and Price spikes --> |Social unrest| Food riots and Protests
        Food riots and Protests --> |Political instability| Regime change and Conflict
        Political instability --> |Economic collapse| Hyperinflation and Unemployment
        Economic collapse --> |Institutional breakdown| Disruption of basic services
        Disruption of basic services --> |Public health crisis| Outbreak of disease

    section Consequences
        Social unrest --> |Violence and conflict| War and Genocide
        War and Genocide --> |Mass migration| Refugee crisis and Humanitarian disaster
        Refugee crisis and Humanitarian disaster --> |Human suffering| Poverty and Inequality
        Poverty and Inequality --> |Environmental degradation| Ecological collapse and Biodiversity loss
        Ecological collapse --> |Long-term effects| Irreversible damage to ecosystems and Human civilization
        Long-term effects --> |Catastrophic scenarios| Extinction of life on Earth and Collapse of civilization
