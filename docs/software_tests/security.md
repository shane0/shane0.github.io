# software security

- many software bugs and security problems are simply due to the fact that we use punctuation in code

| Rank | Vulnerability                                | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | SQL Injection                                | An attacker inserts malicious SQL statements into an entry field, causing the database to execute unintended commands.                              |
| 2    | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)                   | An attacker injects malicious code into a website, which is then executed by a user's web browser.                                                  |
| 3    | Broken Authentication and Session Management | A flaw that allows an attacker to access user accounts or sessions without proper authentication or authorization.                                  |
| 4    | Insecure Direct Object References            | A vulnerability that allows an attacker to manipulate data by modifying parameters that reference database objects directly.                        |
| 5    | Security Misconfiguration                    | Improper configuration of security settings, such as weak passwords or open ports, can leave systems vulnerable to attack.                          |
| 6    | Insufficient Input Validation                | A vulnerability that arises when user input is not properly validated, allowing attackers to submit malicious input that can compromise the system. |
| 7    | Broken Access Control                        | A vulnerability that allows an attacker to access unauthorized resources or perform unauthorized actions by bypassing access control measures.      |
| 8    | Insufficient Cryptography                    | Weak or poorly implemented encryption can leave sensitive data vulnerable to attack.                                                                |
| 9    | Injection Flaws                              | Similar to SQL injection, these vulnerabilities allow an attacker to inject malicious code or commands into an application or database.             |
| 10   | Malware                                      | Malicious software that can include viruses, worms, and Trojan horses, among others, can infiltrate systems and compromise data.                    |

AI software is increasingly being used in the criminal justice system to determine bail, risk assessment, and other decisions. One example of such software is COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions), which is used in several states in the United States. COMPAS uses a proprietary algorithm to analyze data about an individual's criminal history, demographic information, and other factors to produce a "risk score" that judges can use in making decisions about bail and sentencing. However, the use of AI in the criminal justice system has been criticized for perpetuating bias and discrimination, particularly against marginalized communities.
