# Vipassana meditation

- Choose a quiet and comfortable place to meditate, where you will not be disturbed.
- Sit in a relaxed yet upright posture, either on a cushion or a chair, with your back straight and your eyes closed.
- Bring your awareness to your breath and focus on the sensation of the air entering and leaving your nostrils.
- When you notice your mind has wandered, gently bring your focus back to your breath.
- Expand your awareness to include your body, starting from the top of your head and moving down to your toes.
- As you scan your body, observe any sensations or emotions that arise without judgment. Simply note them and return your focus to your breath.
- With regular practice, you may start to experience deeper insights into the nature of reality and the self.
- Continue practicing regularly, gradually increasing the length of your meditation sessions over time.

Remember, meditation is a process that takes time, patience, and consistent effort. It is important to approach it with a non-judgmental attitude and to be kind and patient with yourself as you develop your practice.

"the goal of vipaśyanā is to realize the emptiness of all phenomena"

-- Alan Wallace from the book Heart of the Great Perfection

vipaśyanā (Skt., Tib. lhag mthong ). Lit. “superior vision,” contemplative insight into fundamental aspects of reality, such as impermanence, suffering, nonself, identylessness and emptiness.

-- Alan Wallace from the book Heart of the Great Perfection

"vipashyana (Skt.) Insight, clear seeing. Vipashyana meditation emphasizes the recognition of all that appears arises from emptiness; it is inseperable from emptiness, and it dissolves into emptiness. Vipashyana is the direct, experiential insight that all experience does indeed appear, yet cannot be captured by words and concepts, and so is fundamentally as ungraspable and groundless as space."

-- Mingyur Rinpoche from his book Turning Confusion into Clarity
