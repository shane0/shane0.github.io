Discourse on the Not-self Characteristic.

It is one of the most important discourses in Buddhism, and it is found in the Pali Canon, which is the collection of scriptures in Theravada Buddhism.

In this discourse, the Buddha explains how the idea of a self is formed through the interaction of the five aggregates (form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness). He explains that each of the aggregates is not self, impermanent, and subject to suffering. The idea of a self is formed when the aggregates are mistaken to be self, or when they are clung to as self.

The Buddha explains that this misunderstanding of the aggregates as self is the root of all suffering, and that the practice of understanding the not-self characteristic is crucial to attaining liberation from suffering.
