## how do you practice dzogchen

Dzogchen (Tibetan: རྫོགས་ཆེན, Wylie: rdzogs chen) is a meditation practice in the Nyingma tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. The goal of Dzogchen is to directly realize the ultimate nature of reality, which is referred to as "rigpa" or "pure awareness".

The instructions for practicing Dzogchen typically involve a series of steps, which can be summarized as follows:

Receiving the transmission and blessings of a qualified teacher: Dzogchen is traditionally taught through a personal transmission from a qualified teacher, who will impart the necessary blessings and guidance for the practice.

Cultivating stability in meditation: It is important to have a solid foundation in meditation, including stable posture, proper breathing, and a relaxed mind.

Recognizing the nature of the mind: The goal of Dzogchen is to directly realize the ultimate nature of reality, which is referred to as rigpa. This requires a shift in perception from ordinary dualistic thinking to an open and spacious awareness.

Resting in the natural state: Once the mind is stabilized in its natural state, the practitioner will simply rest in that state and experience rigpa directly.

Continuing the practice: Dzogchen is a continuous process of resting in rigpa and experiencing its ultimate nature. It is recommended to engage in regular practice and to seek the guidance of a qualified teacher as needed.

It is important to note that Dzogchen is a advanced meditation practice and should only be attempted under the guidance of a qualified teacher. It is not recommended for beginners or those without a solid foundation in meditation.

## what are the attributes of rigpa

Rigpa is a term in Tibetan Buddhism that refers to the ultimate nature of reality, also known as "pure awareness." In the context of Dzogchen meditation, rigpa is considered to be the primordial, pure, and unchanging state of consciousness that is free from dualistic thinking and the conventional understanding of self.

The attributes of rigpa are described in various ways in the teachings of Dzogchen, but some of the most common attributes include:

Clarity: Rigpa is described as being clear, transparent, and free from any mental or emotional agitation.

Openness: Rigpa is said to be open and spacious, allowing for a boundless perspective on reality.

Non-dual: Rigpa is said to be beyond dualistic thinking and beyond the conventional understanding of self and other.

Unobstructed: Rigpa is said to be unobstructed and unaffected by the dualistic distinctions of good and bad, right and wrong, etc.

Self-aware: Rigpa is described as being self-aware, with the ability to know itself without reference to any external objects or thoughts.

Natural: Rigpa is said to be natural, uncontrived, and always present, but obscured by the dualistic thinking and emotional afflictions of the ordinary mind.

These attributes are considered to be the essential qualities of rigpa, which can be directly experienced through the practice of Dzogchen meditation. However, it is important to note that these descriptions of rigpa are meant to be pointers or guides rather than definitive explanations of its nature. The ultimate nature of rigpa can only be directly experienced through practice, and not through conceptual understanding.

In Dzogchen, it is said that this state of awareness is always present within us, but is obscured by our dualistic mind and our habitual tendencies.

The goal of Dzogchen practice is to directly realize this spontaneous presence, which is said to bring about a sense of freedom, peace, and joy. Through the practice of mindfulness, introspection, and direct recognition, Dzogchen practitioners aim to dissolve the veil of ignorance that covers their true nature, and to experience their own spontaneous presence as the foundation of all existence.

## what type of meditation uses emptiness?

In Buddhism, meditation on emptiness (also called "shunyata" or "the emptiness of self") is a central practice in some schools, especially the Mahayana tradition. This type of meditation involves contemplating the nature of reality and our own perception of it, with the goal of understanding the concept of emptiness. Emptiness meditation is often used as a means of reducing attachment and achieving liberation from suffering.

The exact methods of emptiness meditation can vary depending on the specific tradition, but some common practices include analytical meditation, in which one reflects on the emptiness of all phenomena, and calm abiding meditation, in which one maintains a stable and focused mind. In both cases, the goal is to develop insight into the ultimate nature of reality and the interdependence of all phenomena.

It's important to approach emptiness meditation with the guidance of a qualified teacher and to maintain a strong foundation in ethics and mindfulness practices, as this type of meditation can be challenging and may require a certain level of maturity and understanding.
