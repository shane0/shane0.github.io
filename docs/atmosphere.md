## formation

In summary, an atmosphere forms on a planet through the process of outgassing, which releases trapped gases from the planet's interior. The amount and composition of the atmosphere depend on various factors, including the planet's size, distance from the sun, magnetic field and chemical composition of its surface.

| Troposphere | 0 - 12 km | Decreases with height | 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% other gases |
| Stratosphere | 12 - 50 km | Increases with height | Ozone layer (O3), 21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen, 1% other gases |
| Mesosphere | 50 - 85 km | Decreases with height | 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% other gases |
| Thermosphere | 85 - 600 km | Increases with height | Ionized gases (plasma) |
| Exosphere | 600+ km | Increases with height | Low density gases and atoms (hydrogen, helium, oxygen, nitrogen) |

| Element | Percent by Volume |
|---------|------------------|
| Nitrogen | 78.084%          |
| Oxygen  | 20.946%          |
| Argon  | 0.934%           |
| Carbon dioxide | 0.04% |
| Neon | 0.0018% |
| Helium | 0.0005% |
| Methane | 0.00017% |
| Hydrogen | 0.00005% |
| Nitrous oxide | 0.00003% |
| Ozone | 0.000004% |

The nitrogen cycle, which involves nitrogen-fixing bacteria, lightning, and other processes, helps to maintain the balance of nitrogen in the atmosphere and the biosphere.

The oxygen cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which oxygen is exchanged between the Earth's atmosphere, biosphere, and geosphere. The oxygen cycle includes processes like photosynthesis by plants and phytoplankton, respiration by animals and bacteria, and decomposition of organic matter.

During photosynthesis, plants and phytoplankton use carbon dioxide and light energy to produce oxygen and organic compounds. Oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a by-product of this process. During respiration, animals and bacteria consume oxygen and release carbon dioxide. Decomposition of organic matter also consumes oxygen and releases carbon dioxide.

Overall, the oxygen cycle maintains a relatively stable balance of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere, which is necessary for the survival of many forms of life.

It is estimated that the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has increased by about 47% since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, which corresponds to an increase of about 120 parts per million (ppm). Before the Industrial Revolution, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere was about 280 ppm, and as of 2021, it has reached about 415 ppm. Therefore, it can be said that approximately 35% of the total CO2 content in the atmosphere is estimated to be caused by the Industrial Revolution.

| Property                     | Explanation                                                                                                   |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Polarity                     | Water molecules have a partial negative charge near the oxygen atom and a partial positive charge near the hydrogen atoms, making it a polar molecule. |
| High specific heat capacity  | Water can absorb a lot of heat energy before its temperature rises, which helps regulate Earth's temperature.    |
| High heat of vaporization    | Water requires a lot of energy to turn into a gas, which makes sweating an effective way to cool down.           |
| High surface tension         | Water molecules are attracted to each other, which creates a strong surface tension that can support small objects. |
| Low density of ice           | Water expands as it freezes, which makes ice less dense than liquid water and allows it to float.              |
| Good solvent                  | Water is an excellent solvent for many substances, including salts and sugars.                                 |

Changes in temperature of water (H2O) can affect the atmosphere in several ways. For example, as water temperature increases, it can lead to more water vapor in the atmosphere, which is a potent greenhouse gas. This increased water vapor can cause a positive feedback loop, where the warmer temperatures lead to more water vapor, which leads to even warmer temperatures. On the other hand, colder water temperatures can cause less water vapor to be present in the atmosphere, which can have a cooling effect.

Changes in water temperature can also affect the circulation of the atmosphere, as warm water tends to rise and cool water tends to sink. This can influence the formation of weather patterns, such as the formation of low-pressure systems and the movement of storms.

Overall, changes in water temperature can have significant impacts on the atmosphere and climate, and are an important factor to consider in understanding how the Earth's climate is changing.

The properties of H2O that cause it to form clouds and rain are its ability to change its state from gas to liquid and vice versa, and its strong cohesive forces. As water vapor rises in the atmosphere, it cools and condenses into liquid droplets or ice crystals, forming clouds. These droplets or crystals grow larger as they collide and stick together, and eventually become too heavy to remain suspended in the air, falling to the ground as precipitation. The cohesive forces between water molecules also allow for the formation of surface tension, which allows water droplets to cling to surfaces and form into the shapes of clouds.

## atmospheric requirements for humans

Humans require a specific range of atmospheric conditions to survive. The ideal atmospheric conditions for human life include:

- Oxygen: Humans require oxygen to breathe. The ideal oxygen concentration for humans is between 19.5% and 23.5% by volume.
- Carbon Dioxide: While humans exhale carbon dioxide, high concentrations of carbon dioxide can be harmful. The ideal concentration of carbon dioxide is less than 0.1% by volume.
- Nitrogen: Nitrogen makes up the majority of Earth's atmosphere and is not harmful to humans. The ideal concentration of nitrogen is between 78% and 80% by volume.
- Trace Gases: Other gases such as argon, helium, and neon are present in trace amounts in Earth's atmosphere and are not harmful to humans.

In addition to these atmospheric conditions, humans also require the atmosphere to be at a comfortable temperature and pressure. The ideal temperature range for human comfort is between 18째C and 25째C (64째F to 77째F), and the ideal atmospheric pressure is between 1013 and 1015 hectopascals (hPa).

If any of these atmospheric requirements are not met, it can result in adverse health effects for humans, such as hypoxia (low oxygen), hypercapnia (high carbon dioxide), or decompression sickness (low pressure).

## heat pumps

| Process      | Description                                                          |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Evaporation  | Heat pump absorbs heat from a low-temperature source (e.g., air)     |
| Compression  | Compressor raises the temperature and pressure of the refrigerant    |
| Condensation | Heat is released as the refrigerant condenses into a liquid          |
| Expansion    | Pressure of the refrigerant is reduced as it moves through the valve |

## greenhouse gas

According to a 2021 study by Oxfam, the world's top 1% of income earners (which includes many billionaires) are responsible for {++more than twice as much carbon emissions as the bottom 50% of the population combined++}.

The report estimates that the top 10% of income earners (which likely includes most billionaires) are responsible for around 52% of global emissions.

Based on these estimates, we could assume that the average billionaire is responsible for emitting {++at least several hundred metric tons of CO2 per year, if not more++}.

Some common sources of carbon emissions among the ultra-wealthy may include private jet travel, yacht ownership and use, ownership of multiple large homes, and investments in high-emitting industries such as fossil fuels.

Additionally, some billionaires may have significant carbon footprints associated with their philanthropic activities, such as funding large-scale construction projects or investing in technologies that require significant energy use.

## IPCC releases

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) releases periodic reports that provide a comprehensive assessment of the state of knowledge on climate change. The latest IPCC report is the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), which was released in three parts between August 2021 and August 2022.

The summary for policymakers of the AR6 Working Group I report, which focuses on the physical science basis of climate change, was released in August 2021. The key findings of the report include:

The unequivocal warming of the climate system is evident from many lines of evidence, including increases in global surface temperature, sea level rise, and melting of snow and ice.

Human influence has warmed the climate at a rate that is unprecedented in at least the last 2,000 years. It is extremely likely (95-100% probability) that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, are the main cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.

The global surface temperature has already increased by 1.1째C (짹0.1째C) above pre-industrial levels, and further warming is inevitable over the next few decades, regardless of future emissions.

The impacts of climate change are already being felt in many regions and ecosystems, and they will increase with further warming. These impacts include more frequent and intense heatwaves, floods, droughts, and storms, as well as sea level rise and ocean acidification.

The best way to limit future warming is to rapidly and deeply reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Even if emissions are reduced to net zero, further warming is expected for many decades or centuries due to the long lifetime of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

The Working Group II report, which focuses on the impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability of human and natural systems to climate change, was released in February 2022. The Working Group III report, which focuses on options for mitigating climate change, was released in August 2022. The reports provide a comprehensive assessment of the latest scientific, technical, and socioeconomic information related to climate change, and will inform policy decisions at the global, regional, and national levels.

## generators of co2

The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by different forms of transportation can vary widely, depending on factors such as fuel type, vehicle efficiency, and usage patterns. However, here are some rough estimates of the CO2 emissions generated by various forms of transportation:

- Automobiles: The average passenger car emits approximately 4.6 metric tons of CO2 per year. Light-duty trucks and SUVs typically emit more, while more fuel-efficient cars can emit less.
- Aviation: The emissions generated by air travel can vary widely depending on the type of aircraft, fuel efficiency, and the length of the flight. On average, a single passenger flying on a commercial flight emits approximately 0.6 metric tons of CO2 per hour of flight time.
- Shipping: The shipping industry is responsible for roughly 2-3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, primarily due to the burning of heavy fuel oil. The exact amount of CO2 emitted by a single ship depends on factors such as the size and type of ship, fuel efficiency, and shipping routes.
- Rail: The emissions generated by rail transportation depend on the type of power source. Diesel-powered trains emit CO2, while electrically powered trains can emit less if powered by clean, renewable energy sources.
- Public transit: The emissions generated by public transit, such as buses and trains, depend on the type of vehicle and the energy source used to power it. Buses powered by diesel or compressed natural gas emit CO2, while electrically powered buses and trains emit less if powered by clean, renewable energy sources.

### total co2 6.6 trillion pounds

This estimate would result in a total mass of CO2 in the atmosphere of around 3 trillion metric tons, or approximately 6.6 trillion pounds.

### cars 5 billion metric tons (annual)

annually, a rough estimate is that the global automobile fleet generates around 4 to 5 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions per year.

### planes 1 billion metric tons (annual)?

- chagpt might need tuning, this looks incorrect

The exact amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions generated by the aviation industry, including both international and domestic flights, is difficult to quantify with certainty. However, various estimates suggest that global aviation could be responsible for around {==2 to 3 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions==), which could translate to over {==1 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions per year.==}

According to the International Civil Aviation Organization  ICAO , the global aviation industry was responsible for approximately 915 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 2019. This represents approximately 2% of global CO2 emissions from human activities.

### amount required to raise the temp one degree F

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC, the average global CONCENTRATION of CO2 in the atmosphere in 2019 was around 417 parts per million (ppm), and the estimated volume of the troposphere is around 5.1 x 10^18 cubic meters.

a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations from preindustrial levels (which were around 280 parts per million) is likely to cause a global average temperature increase {==between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 and 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit)==}

To achieve a doubling of CO2 concentrations, the atmospheric CONCENTRATION of CO2 would need to reach around 560 parts per million. Currently, the atmospheric CONCENTRATION of CO2 is around 417 parts per million (as of 2019).

## rate of temperature increase

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global surface temperature has already increased by {==1.1째C (짹0.1째C)==} above pre-industrial levels, and further warming is inevitable over the next few decades, ==regardless of future emissions==.

The rate of temperature increase has not been constant over time and varies from year to year, but on average, the rate of global temperature increase over the past 50 years (1971-2020) has been approximately {==0.13째C (짹0.03째C) per decade==}.

This rate of increase is more than twice as fast as the rate of temperature increase over the past 100 years (1901-2020), which was approximately {==0.06째C (짹0.04째C) per decade==}. The rate of temperature increase is expected to continue to accelerate in the coming decades unless greenhouse gas emissions are rapidly and deeply reduced.
