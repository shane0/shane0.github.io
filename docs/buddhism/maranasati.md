## what are the 9 steps for maranasati?

The 9 steps of Maranasati (MINDFULNESS of death) meditation in the Theravada tradition are a series of contemplations designed to help the practitioner develop a deeper understanding of the nature of impermanence and the preciousness of life. Here is a general outline of the 9 steps of Maranasati meditation:

1. Recognizing the {++inevitability++} of death: Contemplate the fact that all living beings, including yourself, will eventually die.
1. Reflecting on your own {++mortality++}: Consider the fact that you yourself are subject to the same inevitability of death as all other beings.
1. {++Examining++} your own life: Consider how you have lived your life up to this point, and reflect on whether or not you have used your time wisely.
1. Reflecting on the {++fleeting nature++} of life: Consider how quickly life passes, and how little time you have to accomplish your goals and fulfill your aspirations.
1. Reflection on the {++universality of death++}: Consider that death is not something that happens to others, but is an inescapable aspect of life for all beings.
1. Reflecting on the {++unpredictable nature++} of death: Consider that death can happen at any moment, without warning, and that you are never truly secure.
1. Reflecting on the {++impermanence++} of life: Consider that everything in life is subject to change and that everything is temporary.
1. Developing a sense of {++urgency++}: Consider that your time is limited, and that you should take advantage of every moment to develop your spiritual practice and grow in wisdom.
1. Cultivating the desire to live a virtuous life: Consider the impact that your actions have on others, and strive to live a virtuous life that benefits both yourself and others.

These 9 steps of Maranasati meditation are meant to be practiced regularly, in order to cultivate a deeper understanding of the nature of impermanence and the preciousness of life. By contemplating death in a MINDFUL and contemplative manner, the practitioner can develop a greater sense of urgency, compassion, and wisdom, and can live their life with greater meaning and purpose.

## what are the benefits of maranasati?

Maranasati is a Buddhist meditation practice that involves contemplating death and impermanence. The benefits of practicing maranasati can include:

- A greater {==appreciation of the present moment==}: By contemplating death, practitioners may develop a greater appreciation for the present moment and a deeper sense of gratitude for life.
- {==Reduced attachment==}: By contemplating the impermanence of all things, practitioners may become less attached to material possessions and to the self, reducing suffering and increasing peace of mind.
- Improved {==wisdom and understanding==}: Maranasati can help practitioners develop a deeper understanding of the nature of reality and the Buddhist teachings, leading to increased wisdom and insight.
- {==Overcoming fear of death==}: By contemplating death, practitioners can overcome fear and anxiety about the end of life, and develop a more peaceful and accepting attitude towards death.
- {==Greater motivation to practice the Dharma==}: Maranasati can serve as a powerful reminder of the urgency of the spiritual path and motivate practitioners to engage in other Buddhist practices more fully.

It's important to approach maranasati meditation with the guidance of a qualified teacher and to maintain a strong foundation in ethics and MINDFULNESS practices, as this type of meditation can be challenging and may require a certain level of maturity and understanding.

If you never face your greatest fears you can spend a lifetime in a sort of trance, asleep, with these fears driving you to act in unwholesome ways, it can cause distraction, restlessness, misdirected goals, etc.

At death the goal is to have treated others with equanimity, love and compassion because the only thing you take with you at death is good karma which comes from a lifetime of wholesome actions.  They meditate on death to overcome fears that could cause you to act compulsively and unwholesome throughout life generating bad karma to be carried into the next life.

In buddhism one of the reasons you meditate is to prepare for your death, you can hear more about their traditions in the video above.  In the end what is valued is your ability to remain fully aware your entire life, and to prepare for death at any moment, to remain aware even when asleep and aware specifically during the experience of death, or bardo (transition during death) which has it's own specific set of techniques in some traditions.
