## cormac haunting me

## maranasati

- I have been busy, I keep keep forgetting to practice [maranasati](../maranasati.md)
- I am going to update that page now as I meditate and update the glossary on this site

### condensing the maranasati page

- if you're not familiar with {--death--} meditation, it's not about being a masochist
- I'm going to add some highlighting to that paragraph
- it's for motivation, love, compassion, being [skillful](../karma.md)

### chatgtp

- asking ai, will we live forever or wipe ourselves out? both are very likely lol
- Reflecting on the unpredictable nature of death: Consider that death can happen at any moment, without warning, and that you are never truly secure.
- wow... ok if I had to pick one of these, the best case scenario is losing my eyes!!!! wow lol
- very stoic, but consider going blind vs losing your entire brain function?  or heart problems

The organs that fail most frequently in humans can vary depending on factors such as age, lifestyle, and underlying health conditions. However, some of the most common organs that can fail or become damaged in humans include:

- Heart: Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and occurs when the heart muscle becomes damaged or weak, leading to reduced blood flow and potentially fatal consequences.
- Lungs: Lung disease can cause difficulty breathing, coughing, and fatigue, and can be caused by a variety of factors including smoking, pollution, and genetic disorders.
- Liver: The liver is responsible for filtering toxins and processing nutrients in the body, and can be damaged by excessive alcohol consumption, viral infections, and other factors.
- Kidneys: The kidneys filter waste products from the blood, and can be damaged by infections, high blood pressure, and other factors, leading to chronic kidney disease or even kidney failure.
- Pancreas: The pancreas produces insulin, which regulates blood sugar levels in the body, and can be damaged by conditions such as pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer.
- Brain: Stroke, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's can all lead to damage or failure of the brain.
- Intestines: Conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and colon cancer can all cause damage to the intestines, leading to reduced nutrient absorption and other complications.
- Eyes: Age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and cataracts are all common eye conditions that can lead to vision loss or blindness.

It's important to note that many of these conditions can be prevented or managed through healthy lifestyle choices such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, and avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption, as well as seeking medical attention for any concerning symptoms.

### intestines

- speaking of intestines, reminds me of a fun fact about nutrient absorption

One study published in the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology found that the production of pancreatic enzymes in healthy adults {==decreased by about 10% per decade after the age of 30.==}

Another study published in the Journal of Nutrition and Health Aging found that the activity of digestive enzymes {==decreased by about 30-40% in older adults compared to younger adults.==}

However, these studies focused on specific digestive enzymes and may not reflect the full range of enzymes involved in digestion.

It's important to note that the decline in digestive enzyme production can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as poor diet, stress, and certain medical conditions.

Additionally, there are steps that can be taken to support digestive health as a person ages, such as eating a balanced diet, staying hydrated, and getting regular exercise.

If a person is experiencing digestive issues, they should talk to their healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.
