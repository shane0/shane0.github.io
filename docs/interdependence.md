## twelve nidanas

The term "nidana" means "cause" or "link."

The Twelve Nidanas are a fundamental teaching in Theravada Buddhism that describe the interdependent chain of events leading to the arising of suffering.

The Twelve Nidanas can be thought of as a wheel, with each link leading to the next and forming a continuous cycle.

The Twelve Nidanas are:

1. Ignorance (Avijja)
1. Volitional Actions (Samskara)
1. Consciousness (Vijnana)
1. Name-and-Form (Namarupa)
1. Six Sense Bases (Sadayatana)
1. Contact (Sparsa)
1. Feeling (Vedana)
1. Craving (Tanha)
1. Clinging (Upadana)
1. Becoming (Bhava)
1. Birth (Jati)
1. Aging and Death (Jaramarana)

Each link leads to the next, creating a cycle of suffering and rebirth.

Understanding the Twelve Nidanas is seen as a key step in realizing the impermanence of all things and in developing the wisdom and insight necessary for liberation from suffering.

## how do you meditate with Paticca Samuppada

Meditating with the teaching of Paticca Samuppada, also known as Dependent Origination, can be a powerful way to gain insight into the nature of reality and the causes of suffering. Here are some steps you can follow to meditate with Paticca Samuppada:

- Find a quiet place to sit: Choose a quiet and comfortable place where you won't be disturbed. Sit comfortably, either in a chair or cross-legged on a cushion.
- Focus on your breath: Take a few deep breaths and then bring your attention to your breath. Focus on the sensation of the breath as it moves in and out of your body.
- Consider the Twelve Nidanas: Start with the first nidana, ignorance, and imagine the arising of this link in your mind. Then move on to the next nidana, volitional actions, and so on, until you reach the last nidana, aging and death.
- Reflect on the interdependence of the links: As you go through each nidana, reflect on how each link leads to the next and how they are all interconnected. Consider the ways in which your own experiences align with the cycle of suffering described by the Twelve Nidanas.
- Observe your thoughts and feelings: As you meditate, observe any thoughts or feelings that arise. Don't try to suppress them or get rid of them, simply observe them and let them pass.
- Continue the meditation: Continue meditating on the Twelve Nidanas for as long as you like, focusing on the interdependence of the links and the impermanence of all things.
- End the meditation: When you're ready to end the meditation, take a few deep breaths, stretch if you need to, and return to your day with a greater sense of insight and clarity.

It may take some time and practice to fully understand the teachings of Paticca Samuppada through meditation, but with consistent practice, you can gain a deeper understanding of the nature of reality and the causes of suffering. It's important to remember that meditation is a personal journey, and what works for one person may not work for another, so be patient and kind to yourself as you explore.

## in theravada what is dependent origination?

Dependent Origination is a key teaching in Theravada Buddhism and is also known as "Paticca Samuppada." It refers to the idea that all phenomena arise in dependence upon other factors, and that they are not created independently. The teaching states that the existence of one thing is dependent upon the existence of other things, and that everything is interrelated and interdependent.

The teaching of Dependent Origination is often illustrated with the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination, which describe the interrelated chain of events that lead to the arising of suffering. According to this teaching, ignorance leads to craving and attachment, which in turn leads to existence, birth, aging, and death, and so on, resulting in suffering.

The goal of understanding Dependent Origination is to realize the impermanence of all things and to see that everything is subject to change and that nothing has a permanent self. This realization leads to the development of insight and wisdom, and the eventual liberation from suffering.
