Four Immeasurable Minds

Love in Sanskrit is maitri; in Pali it is metta. Compassion is karuna in both languages. Joy is mudita. Equanimity is upeksha in Sanskrit and upekkha in Pali. A vihara is an abode or a dwelling place. The Four Brahmaviharas are the abodes of true love. This address is much greater than a four-star hotel. It is a 1,000-star dwelling. The Four Brahmaviharas are called “immeasurable,” because if you practice them, they will grow in you every day until they embrace the whole world. You will become happier, and everyone around you will become happier, also.”

1. Samkhara-dukkha: This refers to the suffering that arises from the impermanence of all things, including pleasant experiences that are bound to change or come to an end.
1. Viparinama-dukkha: This refers to the suffering that arises from our tendency to cling to things or experiences that are impermanent and constantly changing. This includes the suffering that arises from attachment, craving, and aversion.

1. Fame and obscurity: the experience of being well-known or unknown to others
1. Pleasure and pain: the experience of physical or emotional pleasure or pain
1. Honor and disgrace: the experience of being honored or disgraced by others
1. Hope and despair: the experience of feeling hopeful or hopeless about the future
1. Approval and disapproval: the experience of receiving approval or disapproval from others
1. Gain and non-gain: the experience of gaining something we want or not gaining it.

## DISAPPOINTMENT

![](../images/b.jpg)

We must surrender our hopes and expectations, as well as our fears, and march directly into disappointment, work with disappointment, go into it and make it our way of life. . . . If we can open, then we suddenly begin to see that our expectations are irrelevant compared with the reality of the situations we are facing. This automatically brings disappointment. Disappointment is the best chariot to use on the path of the dharma. It does not confirm the existence of our ego and its dreams.
