# jay garfield

- this is a perfect example of the [feynman technique](feynman.md)
- jay clearly has a very deep understanding of buddhism and non duality
- I recommend his videos and book "losing ourselves"
- this video speaks volumes, it summarizes the essence of all of the content here
- of all the content I've been exposed to on meditation jay explains it better than chat gpt or any human I've heard teach
- chat gpt has no conent for jay, I'm sending feedback on that
