## 8 concepts

In Buddhism we talk about the Eight Concepts:

- birth
- death
- permanence
- dissolution
- coming
- going
- one
- and many

The practice to end attachment to these eight ideas is called the Eight No’s of the Middle Way

- no birth
- no death
- no permanence
- no dissolution
- no coming
- no going
- no one
- no many

In the thirteenth century in Vietnam, someone asked Master Tue Trung a question following a Dharma talk, and he replied, “Having offered complete release from the Eight Concepts, what further explanation could I possibly give?”

Once these eight ideas have been destroyed, we touch nirvana.

Nirvana is release from the Eight Concepts, and also from their opposites

- impermanence
- nonself
- Interdependent Co-Arising
- emptiness
