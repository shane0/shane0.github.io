# Vipassana meditation

## definitions

"the goal of vipaśyanā is to realize the EMPTINESS of all phenomena"

-- Alan Wallace from the book Heart of the Great Perfection

vipaśyanā (Skt., Tib. lhag mthong ). Lit. “superior vision,” contemplative insight into fundamental aspects of reality, such as impermanence, suffering, nonself, identylessness and emptiness.

-- Alan Wallace from the book Heart of the Great Perfection

"vipashyana (Skt.) Insight, clear seeing. Vipashyana meditation emphasizes the recognition of all that appears arises from emptiness; it is inseperable from emptiness, and it dissolves into emptiness. Vipashyana is the direct, experiential insight that all experience does indeed appear, yet cannot be captured by words and concepts, and so is fundamentally as ungraspable and groundless as space."

-- Mingyur Rinpoche from his book Turning Confusion into Clarity

| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Find a quiet place            | Choose a quiet, peaceful location where you can sit comfortably for an extended period of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Sit in a comfortable position | Choose a comfortable seated position that allows you to sit with your spine straight and your head facing forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Focus on your breath          | Bring your attention to the sensation of your breath as it enters and leaves your body. Observe the breath without trying to control it. If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the breath.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Observe bodily sensations     | After some time, shift your attention to the sensations in your body. Observe any sensations without judging or reacting to them. Simply note the sensations and observe them as they arise and pass away.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Observe thoughts and emotions | As you continue to practice, you will become aware of thoughts and emotions that arise in your mind. Observe these thoughts and emotions with detachment, without getting caught up in them. Simply note them and observe them as they arise and pass away.                                                                                                 |
| Develop equanimity            | As you become more adept at observing bodily sensations, thoughts, and emotions, you may begin to experience intense sensations or emotions. Practice cultivating a sense of equanimity, or balanced awareness, in the face of these experiences. Observe them without reacting or judging them. Simply note them and allow them to pass away on their own. |
| Practice regularly            | Vipassana meditation is a skill that requires regular practice. Aim to practice for at least 20-30 minutes each day. Gradually increase the duration of your practice as you become more comfortable with the technique.                                                                                                                                    |
| Seek guidance as needed       | If you are new to Vipassana meditation, consider seeking guidance from an experienced teacher. They can provide instruction and support to help you develop your practice.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
