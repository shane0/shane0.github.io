## rigpa

Rigpa is a term in Tibetan Buddhism that refers to the ultimate nature of reality, also known as "pure awareness." In the context of Dzogchen meditation, rigpa is considered to be the primordial, pure, and unchanging state of consciousness that is free from dualistic thinking and the conventional understanding of self.

The attributes of rigpa are described in various ways in the teachings of Dzogchen, but some of the most common attributes include:

- Clarity: Rigpa is described as being clear, transparent, and free from any mental or emotional agitation.
- Openness: Rigpa is said to be open and spacious, allowing for a boundless perspective on reality.
- Non-dual: Rigpa is said to be beyond dualistic thinking and beyond the conventional understanding of self and other.
- Unobstructed: Rigpa is said to be unobstructed and unaffected by the dualistic distinctions of good and bad, right and wrong, etc.
- Self-aware: Rigpa is described as being self-aware, with the ability to know itself without reference to any external objects or thoughts.
- Natural: Rigpa is said to be natural, uncontrived, and always present, but obscured by the dualistic thinking and emotional afflictions of the ordinary mind.

These attributes are considered to be the essential qualities of rigpa, which can be directly experienced through the practice of Dzogchen meditation. However, it is important to note that these descriptions of rigpa are meant to be pointers or guides rather than definitive explanations of its nature. The ultimate nature of rigpa can only be directly experienced through practice, and not through conceptual understanding.

- Suspend attention: Once the mind is calm and free from dualistic concepts, allow the mind to rest in its natural state of non-dual awareness. This is known as "suspending attention" or "pure awareness."
- Maintain awareness: Maintain awareness in the non-dual state, and gradually integrate this experience into daily life.
- Practice continually: Continuously cultivate this experience through meditation and the integration of the teachings into daily life.

## Pure awareness

Pure awareness is considered a fundamental aspect of Buddhist teachings and is described as having several attributes. Here are a few of the key attributes of pure awareness:

- Clarity: Pure awareness is characterized by its clarity, brightness, and vividness. It is often described as being like a mirror that reflects everything without judgment or distortion.
- Openness: Pure awareness is said to be open, spacious, and limitless, transcending all limitations and boundaries.
- Non-duality: Pure awareness is non-dual, meaning that it does not discriminate between self and other, subject and object.
- Unconditioned: Pure awareness is considered to be unconditioned, meaning that it is free from the influence of thoughts, emotions, and external conditions.
- Stability: Pure awareness is stable and unchanging, unaffected by the fluctuations of the mind and external conditions.
- Self-sufficient: Pure awareness is said to be self-sufficient, complete, and fulfilling in and of itself, and does not depend on anything else to be realized.

In Buddhist practice, the goal is to cultivate the experience of pure awareness and to integrate this experience into one's daily life.

It is considered a key aspect of spiritual development and a direct path to liberation.

## trekcho

But as the mind that is the object of the search is unreal, so too is the mind that searches. Nevertheless, by clinging to a self in all our vague and transitory thoughts, which are brought about by fleeting causes and conditions, we experience the delusion of saṃsāric existence.

<https://www.lotsawahouse.org/tibetan-masters/jamyang-khyentse-chokyi-lodro/key-points-on-trekcho>

The spiritual path is the process of cutting through our confusion, of uncovering the awakened state of mind. . . . It is not a matter of building up the awakened state of mind but rather of burning out the confusions that obstruct it. In the process of burning out these confusions, we discover enlightenment.

## in dzogchen what is spontaneous presence

In Dzogchen, the highest teaching of the Nyingma tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, "spontaneous presence" refers to the natural, unaltered, and self-existing state of awareness that is said to be the ultimate nature of all beings.

Spontaneous presence is considered to be beyond all concepts, dualities, and mental constructions, and to be a state of pure, non-dual awareness that transcends time and space. In Dzogchen, it is said that this state of awareness is always present within us, but is obscured by our dualistic mind and our habitual tendencies.

The goal of Dzogchen practice is to directly realize this spontaneous presence, which is said to bring about a sense of freedom, peace, and joy.

## samantabhadra thangka

The Samantabhadra Thangka is a traditional Tibetan Buddhist painting that depicts the bodhisattva Samantabhadra, who is associated with universal compassion and the practice of meditation. Thangkas are used as a visual aid for meditation and as a tool for transmitting spiritual teachings.

In the Samantabhadra Thangka, Samantabhadra is often depicted in a central position surrounded by various other bodhisattvas, buddhas, and other spiritual beings. The imagery and symbolism in the thangka are rich with meaning and are meant to convey important teachings and spiritual messages to the viewer.

For example, the white elephant that Samantabhadra is often depicted riding symbolizes the pure, unstained nature of the mind and the ability to rise above ignorance and delusion. The sun and moon behind Samantabhadra's head symbolize the illuminating and all-encompassing nature of wisdom. The aura of light that surrounds Samantabhadra represents the radiance of compassion and the transforming power of bodhicitta, the mind of enlightenment.

The Samantabhadra Thangka can also be interpreted as a visual representation of the ultimate nature of reality. The central figure of Samantabhadra is often surrounded by other buddhas and bodhisattvas, which represents the interdependent nature of all things and the idea that all beings are ultimately interconnected.

Overall, the meanings behind the Samantabhadra Thangka are meant to evoke a sense of reverence, inspiration, and motivation for spiritual practice. Through contemplation and meditation on the thangka, practitioners hope to awaken the qualities of compassion and wisdom that Samantabhadra embodies and to deepen their understanding of the teachings of Buddhism.

## sem vs rigpa

Sem and Rigpa are terms used in the context of Tibetan Buddhism.

Sem refers to ordinary mind or the dualistic mind, which is characterized by the habit of seeing things as separate and discrete, and by the experience of duality, such as subject and object, self and others, and so on.

Rigpa, on the other hand, refers to pure awareness or the non-dual state of mind. It is considered to be the true nature of all beings and is characterized by a state of clarity, openness, and non-duality. In Dzogchen, the highest teaching of the Nyingma tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, rigpa is considered to be the ultimate reality and the foundation of all existence.

In the context of practice, the goal is to recognize and cultivate rigpa, and to let go of the habit of sem. This can be achieved through various methods, including mindfulness, introspection, and direct recognition, which are all aimed at dissolving the veil of ignorance that covers one's true nature and realizing the spontaneous presence of rigpa.

## emptiness

In Buddhism, meditation on EMPTINESS (also called "shunyata" or "the EMPTINESS of self") is a central practice in some schools, especially the Mahayana tradition. This type of meditation involves contemplating the nature of reality and our own perception of it, with the goal of understanding the concept of emptiness. EMPTINESS meditation is often used as a means of reducing attachment and achieving liberation from suffering.

The exact methods of EMPTINESS meditation can vary depending on the specific tradition, but some common practices include analytical meditation, in which one reflects on the EMPTINESS of all phenomena, and calm abiding meditation, in which one maintains a stable and focused mind. In both cases, the goal is to develop insight into the ultimate nature of reality and the interdependence of all phenomena.

It's important to approach EMPTINESS meditation with the guidance of a qualified teacher and to maintain a strong foundation in ethics and MINDFULNESS practices, as this type of meditation can be challenging and may require a certain level of maturity and understanding.

## dream yoga

Dream yoga is a practice within Tibetan Buddhism that aims to help individuals gain awareness and control within the dream state. The following are general steps for practicing dream yoga:

- Preparation: Begin by establishing a regular meditation practice and developing an intention to practice dream yoga.
- Mindfulness and meditation: Before going to bed, practice mindfulness and meditation to calm the mind and prepare for sleep.
- Set an intention: Before going to sleep, set a clear intention to become lucid in your dreams and practice dream yoga.
- Reality checks: Throughout the day, practice checking if you are dreaming by looking at your hands or checking your surroundings. This can help you become more aware within your dreams.
- Dream recall: Upon waking, take some time to recall and write down any dreams you remember. This can help with developing dream awareness and improve dream recall.
- Lucid dreaming: With practice, you may become aware that you are dreaming while in a dream. At this point, you can begin to practice dream yoga.
- Practice: Within the dream, practice mindfulness, and awareness, and try to remain focused and clear-headed. You can also practice visualization or other meditative practices.
- Dedication: Before falling back asleep, dedicate any positive merit generated from your practice to the benefit of all sentient beings.

It's worth noting that dream yoga is a complex practice that may require guidance and training from an experienced teacher.

Staying in a meditative state as you fall asleep can be challenging, as the process of falling asleep can cause you to lose awareness and slip into unconsciousness. However, there are some tips that may be helpful:

- Set a clear intention: Before you lie down to sleep, set a clear intention to stay aware and present as you fall asleep. This can help you stay focused and prevent your mind from wandering.
- Focus on your breath: As you lie down, focus your attention on your breath. Feel the sensations of the breath as it enters and leaves your body. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring it back to the breath.
- Use a mantra: You can also use a mantra or phrase to help you stay focused. For example, you could silently repeat the phrase "I am aware" as you fall asleep.
- Practice relaxation techniques: Relaxation techniques, such as progressive muscle relaxation or visualization, can help you calm your mind and body and stay present as you fall asleep.

Be patient: Remember that staying in a meditative state as you fall asleep can be challenging, especially if you are new to meditation. Be patient with yourself and keep practicing. Over time, you may find it easier to stay aware and present as you fall asleep.

In the northwest of the land of Uddiyana,
In the heart of a lotus flower,

Surrounded by many hosts of dakinis,
Following in your footsteps,
I pray to you: Come and bless me with your grace!"
```
