By examining the five aggregates, practitioners can gain insight into the impermanence and lack of self in all things and develop a more profound understanding of dependent origination, the idea that all phenomena arise in dependence upon other phenomena.</p> <p>Through this insight, practitioners can overcome attachment and ignorance, and eventually attain liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

Here is a general outline of the Theravada instructions for Anapanasati meditation:</p> <p>Find a quiet place to sit: Find a quiet, comfortable place to sit where you will not be disturbed. You can sit in a chair, on a cushion, or on a meditation bench. Maintain good posture and keep your back straight.</p> <p>Focus on the breath: Close your eyes and focus your attention on the sensation of the breath as it enters and leaves your nostrils. Pay close attention to the sensation of the breath and the rise and fall of your chest.</p> <p>Follow the breath: As you focus on the breath, allow your mind to follow it. Do not try to control your breath or change its natural rhythm. If your mind begins to wander, gently bring it back to the breath.</p> <p>Expand your awareness: As you become more relaxed and focused, begin to expand your awareness to include the sensations in your body. Pay attention to any areas of tightness, tension, or discomfort and try to let go of these sensations as you inhale and exhale.</p> <p>Cultivate mindfulness: Continuously cultivate MINDFULNESS of the breath, body sensations, and mental states. Observe your thoughts and emotions with equanimity and detachment.</p> <p>Develop concentration: Over time, try to maintain your focus on the breath for longer and longer periods of time. As your CONCENTRATION improves, you may experience deeper states of peace and tranquility.</p> <p>Integrate meditation into daily life: As you progress in your meditation practice, try to integrate the awareness and MINDFULNESS developed in meditation into your daily life.

The instructions for anapanasati meditation can be outlined as follows:</p> <p>Find a quiet, comfortable place to sit: Choose a place to sit where you will not be disturbed. You can sit in a chair, on a cushion, or on a meditation bench. It is important to maintain good posture and to keep your back straight.</p> <p>Focus on the breath: Begin by closing your eyes and focusing your attention on the sensation of the breath as it enters and leaves your nostrils. Pay close attention to the sensation of the breath and the rise and fall of your chest.</p> <p>Follow the breath: As you focus on the breath, allow your mind to follow it. Don't try to control your breath or change its natural rhythm, simply observe it. If your mind begins to wander, gently bring it back to the breath.</p> <p>Expand your awareness: As you become more relaxed and focused, begin to expand your awareness to include the sensations in your body. Pay attention to any areas of tightness, tension, or discomfort and try to let go of these sensations as you inhale and exhale.</p> <p>Cultivate awareness and compassion: As you continue to practice anapanasati, try to cultivate an awareness of the body, mind, and emotions. See if you can observe your thoughts and emotions with a sense of curiosity and compassion.</p> <p>Maintain focus: Try to maintain your focus on the breath for at least a few minutes at a time. As you become more comfortable with the practice, you can gradually increase the length of your meditation sessions.</p> <p>These are the basic instructions for anapanasati meditation, but there are many variations and approaches to this practice, and individuals may find that certain modifications or modifications work better for them.

He shares with me this ancient teaching from the Vigyan Bhairava and Sochanda Tantra, both written about four thousand years ago, and from Malini Vijaya Tantra, probably another thousand years older yet. It is an ancient teaching, copied and recopied countless times, and from it Lakshmanjoo has made the beginning of an English version. I transcribe it eleven more times to get it into the form given here.</p> <p>Shiva first chanted it to his consort Devi in a language of love we have yet to learn. It is about the Immanent experience. It presents 112 ways to open the invisible door of consciousness. I see Lakshmanjoo gives his life to its practicing.</p> <p>Some of the ways may appear redundant, yet each differs from any other. Some may seem simple, yet any one requires constant dedication even to test it.</p> <p>Machines, ledgers, dancers, athletes balance. Just as centering or balance augments various skills, so it may awareness. As an experiment, try standing equally on both feet; then imagine you are shifting your balance slightly from foot to foot: just as balance centers, do you.</p> <p>If we are conscious in part, this implies more inclusive consciousness. Have you a hand? Yes. That you know without doubt. But until asked the question were you cognizant of the hand apart?</p> <p>Surely men as inspiritors, known and unknown to the world, have shared a common uncommon discovery. The Tao of Lao-tse, Nirvana of Buddha, Jehovah of Moses, the Father of Jesus, the Allah of Mohammed \u2014 all point to the experience.</p> <p>No-thing-ness, spirit \u2013 once touched, the whole life clears.</p> <p>DEVI SAYS:</p> <pre><code>O Shiva, what is your reality?\nWhat is this wonder-filled universe?\nWhat constitutes seed?\nWho centers the universal wheel?\nWhat is tbis life beyond form pervading forms?\nHow may we enter it fully, above space and\ntime, names and descriptions?\nLet my doubts be cleared!\n</code></pre> <p>SHIVA REPLIES</p> <p>[Devi, though already enlightened, has asked the foregoing questions so others through the universe might receive Shiva\u2019s instructions.

After breath comes in (down) and just before turning up (out) \u2014 the beneficence.</p> </li> <li> <p>As breath turns from down to up, and again as breath curves from up to down\u2014through both these turns, realize.</p> </li> <li> <p>Or, whenever inbreath and outbreath fuse, at this instant touch the energyless energy-filled center.</p> </li> <li> <p>Or, when breath is all out (up) and stopped of itself, or all in (down) and stopped\u2014in such universal pause, one\u2019s small self vanishes. This is difficult only for the impure.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider your essence as light rays rising from center to center up the vertebrae, and so rises livingness in you.</p> </li> <li> <p>Or in the spaces between, feel this as lightning.</p> </li> <li> <p>Devi, imagine the Sanskrit letters in these honey-filled foci of awareness, first as letters, then more subtly as sounds, then as most subtle feeling. Then, leaving them aside, be free.</p> </li> <li> <p>Attention between eyebrows, let mind be before thought. Let form fill with breath-essence to the top of the head, and there shower as light.</p> </li> <li> <p>Or, imagine the five-colored circles of the peacock tail to be your five senses in illimitable space. Now let their beauty melt within. Similarly, at any point in space or on a wall \u2014 until the point dissolves. Then your wish for another comes true.</p> </li> <li> <p>Eyes closed, see your inner being in detail. Thus see your true nature.</p> </li> <li> <p>Place your whole attention in the nerve, delicate as the lotus thread, in the center of your spinal column. In such be transformed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Closing the seven openings of the head with your hands, a space between your eyes becomes all-inclusive.</p> </li> <li> <p>Touching eyeballs as a feather, lightness between them opens into heart and there permeates the cosmos.</p> </li> <li> <p>Bathe in the center of sound, as in the continuous sound of a waterfall. Or, by putting fingers in ears, hear the sound of sounds.</p> </li> <li> <p>Intone a sound, as a-u-m, slowly. As sound enters soundfulness, so do you.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the beginning and gradual refinement of the sound of any letter, awake.</p> </li> <li> <p>While listening to stringed instruments, hear their composite central sound; thus omnipresence.</p> </li> <li> <p>Intone a sound audibly, then less and less audibly as feeling deepens into this silent harmony.</p> </li> <li> <p>Imagine spirit simultaneously within and around you until the entire universe spiritualizes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kind Devi, enter etheric presence pervading far above and below your form.</p> </li> <li> <p>Put mindstuff in such inexpressible fineness above, below, and in your heart.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider any area of your present form as limitlessly spacious.</p> </li> <li> <p>Feel your substance, bones, flesh, blood, saturated with cosmic essence.</p> </li> <li> <p>Suppose your passive form to be an empty room with walls of skin \u2013 empty.</p> </li> <li> <p>Blessed one, as senses are absorbed in heart, reach the center of the lotus.</p> </li> <li> <p>Unminding mind, keep in the middle \u2013 until.</p> </li> <li> <p>When in worldly activity, keep attentive between the two breaths, and so practicing, in a few days be born anew.

In a few moments become aware.</p> </li> <li> <p>Abide in some place endlessly spacious, clear of trees, hills, habitations. Thence comes the end of mind pressures.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sweet-hearted one, meditate on knowing and not knowing, existing and not existing. Then leave both aside that you may be.</p> </li> <li> <p>Look lovingly on some object Do not go on to another object. Here, in the middle of this object \u2014 the blessing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Feel cosmos as translucent ever-living presence.</p> </li> <li> <p>With utmost devotion, center on the two junctions of breath and know the knower.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider the plenum to be your own body of bliss.</p> </li> <li> <p>While being caressed, sweet princess, enter the caressing as everlasting life.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stop the doors of senses when feeling the creeping of an ant. Then.</p> </li> <li> <p>At the start of sexual union, keep attention on the fire in the beginning, and, so continuing, avoid the embers in the end.</p> </li> <li> <p>When in such embrace your senses are shaken as leaves, enter this shaking.</p> </li> <li> <p>Even remembering union, without the embrace, the transformation.</p> </li> <li> <p>On joyously seeing a long-absent friend, permeate this joy.</p> </li> <li> <p>When eating or drinking, become the taste of the food or drink, and be filled.</p> </li> <li> <p>0 lotus-eyed one, sweet of touch, when singing, seeing, tasting, be aware you are and discover the ever-living.</p> </li> <li> <p>Wherever satisfaction is found, in whatever act, actualize this.</p> </li> <li> <p>At the point of sleep when sleep has not yet come and external wakefulness vanishes, at this point being is revealed.

Or, as breath comes silently in, feel the sound HH.</p> </li> <li> <p>When on a bed or a seat, let yorself become weightless, beyond mind.</p> </li> <li> <p>In a moving vehicle, by rhythmically swaying, experience. Or in a still vehicle, by letting yourself swing in slowing invisible circles.</p> </li> <li> <p>Simply by looking into the blue sky beyond clouds, the serenity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Shakti, see all space as if already absorbed in your own head in the brilliance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Waking, sleeping, dreaming, know you as light.</p> </li> <li> <p>In rain during a black night, enter that blackness as the form of forms.</p> </li> <li> <p>When a moonless raining night is not present, close eyes and find blackness before you. Opening eyes, see blackness. So faults disappear forever.</p> </li> <li> <p>Just as you have the impulse to do something, stop.</p> </li> <li> <p>Center on the sound a-u-m without any a or m</p> </li> <li> <p>Silently intone a word ending in AH. Then in the HH effortlessly, the spontaneity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Feel yourself as pervading all directions, far, near.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pierce some part of your nectar-filled form with a pin, and gently enter the piercing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Feel: My thought, I-ness, internal organs\u2014me.</p> </li> <li> <p>Illusions deceive. Colors circumscribe. Even divisibles are indivisible.</p> </li> <li> <p>When some desire comes, consider it. Then, suddenly, quit it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Before desire and before knowing, how can I say I am? Consider. Dissolve in the beauty.</p> </li> <li> <p>With your entire consciousness in the very start of desire, of knowing, know.</p> </li> <li> <p>0 Shakti, each particular perception is limited, disappearing in omnipotence.</p> </li> <li> <p>In truth forms are inseparate.

Realize each as made of this consciousness.</p> </li> <li> <p>In moods of extreme desire, be undisturbed.</p> </li> <li> <p>This so-called universe appears as a juggling, a picture show. To be happy look upon it so.</p> </li> <li> <p>0 Beloved, put attention neither on pleasure or pain but between these.</p> </li> <li> <p>Toss attachment for body aside, realizing I am everywhere.

He managed to gain control of a large portion of the potato market by buying up the entire potato crop from farmers across the country and holding onto it in storage facilities. He then waited for the potato prices to rise before selling the potatoes for a profit.</p> <p>Kosuga's actions were not illegal, but they did raise concerns about the potential for individuals to manipulate commodity markets in this way. As a result of his actions, the government introduced new regulations to prevent market manipulation in the future.</p> <p>Silos are used to manipulate agriculture prices by allowing buyers to hold onto their stocks of crops until prices increase. This is known as hoarding, and it can lead to a shortage of crops in the market, which drives prices up. By controlling the supply of crops, silos can create an artificial shortage, allowing the owners to charge higher prices. Additionally, silos can be used to store crops until they can be sold at a more favorable price, further manipulating the market.</p> <p>diamond silo</p> <p>There is no way to accurately determine the value of diamonds that are kept in vaults and not sold, as this information is not publicly available. Diamond companies and traders generally do not disclose the exact amount of inventory they hold, and the value of diamonds can also vary depending on a number of factors such as size, color, and clarity. Additionally, the value of diamonds can fluctuate over time due to changes in market demand and other economic factors.</p>","tags":["impermanence","collapse","overshoot","extinction events","extinction"]},{"location":"collapse/#genome","title":"genome","text":"<p>The Human Genome Project, which was completed in 2003, identified the complete sequence of human DNA, which is estimated to contain approximately 3 billion base pairs. Since then, continued research has led to a better understanding of the structure and function of the human genome. While the majority of the human genome has been identified, there is still much that is not fully understood.</p> <p>It is estimated that only about 1-2% of the human genome encodes for proteins, the functional molecules that perform a wide range of tasks in the cell. The rest of the genome is made up of non-coding DNA, which was once thought to be \"junk\" but is now known to play important roles in regulation of gene expression and other cellular processes.</p> <p>There is a wealth of evidence for evolution, from observations of the natural world to the fossil record to the molecular evidence of DNA. Here are some of the key lines of evidence:</p> <p>Fossil record: The fossil record provides evidence of the evolution of species over time. Fossils of extinct species that were clearly distinct from any species alive today demonstrate that evolution has occurred.</p> <p>Comparative anatomy: The similarities in anatomy and structure among different species can be explained by a common ancestry. For example, the bones of the forelimbs of mammals such as humans, bats, whales, and birds all have the same basic structure, despite their differences in function, indicating that they evolved from a common ancestor.</p> <p>Biochemistry: The similarities in biochemistry and genetics among different species also provide evidence of evolution. For example, all living things use DNA as the genetic material, and the DNA sequences of different species are often similar in specific regions, reflecting a common ancestry.</p> <p>Geographic distribution of species: The geographic distribution of species can also provide evidence for evolution. For example, many species that are found on the same continents or island groups are more similar to each other than to species found elsewhere, suggesting that they evolved from a common ancestor and have diversified over time.</p> <p>Natural selection: Observing the process of natural selection in action, such as the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, provides further evidence of evolution.

Let go of any tension, and focus on your breath.\n- Visualization: Visualize a mandala in your mind's eye. A mandala is a geometric design that represents the universe and can take various forms.\n- Focus: Focus your attention on the center of the mandala, and let your mind become absorbed in its beauty and symmetry.\n- Mantra repetition: Repeat a mantra or a word that has meaning to you. The repetition of the mantra will help you to stay focused and deepen your meditation.\n- Exploration: Explore the details of the mandala, and let your imagination wander. Notice the colors, shapes, and patterns.\n- Integration: Integrate the qualities and characteristics of the mandala into your mind and heart. Allow yourself to be drawn into its inner world and feel a sense of peace and wholeness.\n- Expansion: Expand your awareness to include the entire universe and imagine that you are at one with the cosmos.\n- End: When you feel ready, slowly open your eyes and return to your ordinary state of consciousness. Take a few deep breaths and stretch your limbs.\n\nIt is important to remember that mandala meditation is a tool for developing CONCENTRATION and mindfulness, not just a way to produce beautiful images in your mind.\n\nWith regular practice, you can learn to cultivate a peaceful and centered state of mind that will benefit you in your daily life.\n\n## dream yoga\n\nDream yoga is a practice within Tibetan Buddhism that aims to help individuals gain awareness and control within the dream state. The following are general steps for practicing dream yoga:\n\n- Preparation: Begin by establishing a regular meditation practice and developing an intention to practice dream yoga.\n- Mindfulness and meditation: Before going to bed, practice mindfulness and meditation to calm the mind and prepare for sleep.\n- Set an intention: Before going to sleep, set a clear intention to become lucid in your dreams and practice dream yoga.\n- Reality checks: Throughout the day, practice checking if you are dreaming by looking at your hands or checking your surroundings. This can help you become more aware within your dreams.\n- Dream recall: Upon waking, take some time to recall and write down any dreams you remember. This can help with developing dream awareness and improve dream recall.\n- Lucid dreaming: With practice, you may become aware that you are dreaming while in a dream. At this point, you can begin to practice dream yoga.\n- Practice: Within the dream, practice mindfulness, and awareness, and try to remain focused and clear-headed. You can also practice visualization or other meditative practices.\n- Dedication: Before falling back asleep, dedicate any positive merit generated from your practice to the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\nIt's worth noting that dream yoga is a complex practice that may require guidance and training from an experienced teacher.\n\nStaying in a meditative state as you fall asleep can be challenging, as the process of falling asleep can cause you to lose awareness and slip into unconsciousness. However, there are some tips that may be helpful:\n\n- Set a clear intention: Before you lie down to sleep, set a clear intention to stay aware and present as you fall asleep. This can help you stay focused and prevent your mind from wandering.\n- Focus on your breath: As you lie down, focus your attention on your breath. Feel the sensations of the breath as it enters and leaves your body. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring it back to the breath.\n- Use a mantra: You can also use a mantra or phrase to help you stay focused. For example, you could silently repeat the phrase \"I am aware\" as you fall asleep.\n- Practice relaxation techniques: Relaxation techniques, such as progressive muscle relaxation or visualization, can help you calm your mind and body and stay present as you fall asleep.\n\nBe patient: Remember that staying in a meditative state as you fall asleep can be challenging, especially if you are new to meditation. Be patient with yourself and keep practicing. Over time, you may find it easier to stay aware and present as you fall asleep.\n\n## Seven Line Supplication\n\nThe Seven Line Supplication to Guru Rinpoche, also known as the Seven Line Prayer, is a famous and widely recited prayer in the Nyingma tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. It is considered to be an essential supplication to Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambhava), who is revered as the founder of the Nyingma lineage and the master who brought Buddhism to Tibet.\n\n```text\nThe prayer reads as follows:\n\nHUNG\nORGYEN YUL GYI NUB JANG TSAM\nPEMA GESAR DONGPO LA\nYAM TSEN CHOG GI NGO DRUB NYE\nPEMA JUNGNE SHYABAR SHOL\n\nIt can be translated in English as:\n\n\"HUNG,\nIn the northwest of the land of Uddiyana,\nIn the heart of a lotus flower,\nEndowed with the most marvelous attainments,\nYou are renowned as the Lotus-born,\nSurrounded by many hosts of dakinis,\nFollowing in your footsteps,\nI pray to you: Come and bless me with your grace!\"\n</code></pre> <p>Reciting this prayer is believed to invoke Guru Rinpoche's blessings and to open the heart to his wisdom and compassion.

CO2 dissolves in seawater and reacts with water molecules to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), which in turn releases hydrogen ions (H+) that increase the acidity of the water.

Changes in the Earth's orbit can also affect the amount and distribution of solar radiation, which can impact global temperatures.

However, recent developments in physics suggest that even elementary particles may have some internal structure, and the concept of point particles is being challenged by these new ideas.</p>","tags":["physics","quantum physics","math","cormac mccarthy"]},{"location":"quantum/#top-debates-in-quantum-physics","title":"Top debates in quantum physics","text":"<p>Quantum physics is a field that has generated many debates and controversies over the years, as it challenges our understanding of the nature of the universe.

He also presents the concept of \"store consciousness,\" which is the accumulation of all experiences and memories that make up an individual's unique perception of reality.</p> <p>The Practice of Meditation: Hui-neng emphasizes the importance of meditation and MINDFULNESS as the path to awakening and realization of one's true nature. He teaches that through the practice of meditation, one can calm the mind, still the fluctuations of thought, and awaken to the nature of mind.</p> <p>The Path to Enlightenment: Hui-neng presents a path to enlightenment that emphasizes the importance of direct experience and realization, rather than relying on scriptures or doctrine. He teaches that the ultimate goal of Buddhist practice is to awaken to one's true nature and to attain enlightenment.</p> <p>The Five Ranks: Hui-neng presents the concept of the Five Ranks, which describe the stages of spiritual development and the realization of one's true nature. The Five Ranks are: (1) the rank of ordinary people, (2) the rank of those who have made a spiritual connection, (3) the rank of enlightenment, (4) the rank of great enlightenment, and (5) the rank of those who have transcended enlightenment.</p> <p>The Mind-Only Doctrine: Hui-neng also discusses the Mind-Only doctrine, which teaches that all phenomena arise from the mind and that ultimate reality is not separate from the mind. This doctrine emphasizes the idea that our perceptions and experiences are constructed by the mind, and that true reality cannot be grasped through the senses or intellect.</p> <p>These are the main themes and topics covered in the Platform Sutra, which is a seminal text in the Zen tradition and continues to be studied and practiced by Zen practitioners today.</p>","tags":["non dual","zen","oxherding"]},{"location":"zen/#oxherding-gist","title":"oxherding gist","text":"<ul> <li> <p>this paragraph is using <code>url_download</code> to embed a github gist on this site</p> </li> <li> <p>https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/53660</p> </li> </ul> <pre><code>One aimlessly pushes the grasses\naside in search.\nThe rivers are wide,\nthe mountains far away,\nand the path becomes longer.\nExhausted and dispirited,\none hears only the late autumn cicadas\nshrilling in the maple woods.\n\nBy the water, and under the trees,\nthere are numerous traces.\nFragrant grasses grow thickly,\nbut did you see the ox?\nEven in the depths\nof the distant mountain forest,\nHow could the upturned nostrils\nof the ox be concealed?\n\nA bush warbler sings upon a branch,\nwarm sun, soft breezes,\ngreen willows on the bank.\nNowhere can the ox escape to hide,\nbut those majestic horns\nare difficult to draw.\n\nWith all my energy,\nI seize the ox.\nHis will is strong, and his power endless,\nand he cannot be tamed easily.\nSometimes he charges\nto the high plateau.\nAnd there he stays,\ndeep in the mist.\n\nOne does not let go of the whip or the rope,\nafraid it will stray\nand choose the dusty mist.\nA well-tended ox becomes gentle,\nand even with no rope,\nWill follow people\nby himself.\n\nRiding the bull, I leisurely\nwander toward home.\nExotic flute melodies echo\nthrough sunset clouds.\nEach beat and each tune\nis indescribably profound.\nNo words are needed for those\nwho understand music.\n\nRiding on the ox,\nhe has come home.\nThere is no ox there,\nand he is at ease.\nAlthough the sun is high,\nhe is still dreamy.\nThe whip and rope abandoned\nin the thatched hut.\n\nWhip, rope, man, and ox,\nall are non-existent.\nThe blue sky being vast,\nno message can be heard,\nJust as the snowflake cannot last\nin the flaming red furnace.\nAfter this state, one can join\nthe ancient teachers.\n\nIn returning to the fundamentals\nand going back to the source,\nI had to work so hard.\nPerhaps it would be better\nto be blind and deaf.\nBeing in the hut,\nI do not see what is outside.\nThe river flowing tranquilly,\nthe flower simply being red.\n\nHe enters the city barefoot,\nwith chest exposed.\nCovered in dust and ashes,\nsmiling broadly.\nNo need for the magic powers\nof the gods and immortals.\nJust let the dead tree bloom again.\n</code></pre>","tags":["non dual","zen","oxherding"]},{"location":"zen/#more-koans","title":"more koans","text":"Koan Person Link What is the sound of one hand clapping?

They are:</p> <ol> <li>Dukkha-dukkha: This refers to the suffering that arises from painful experiences, such as sickness, old age, and death.</li> <li>Samkhara-dukkha: This refers to the suffering that arises from the impermanence of all things, including pleasant experiences that are bound to change or come to an end.</li> <li>Viparinama-dukkha: This refers to the suffering that arises from our tendency to cling to things or experiences that are impermanent and constantly changing. This includes the suffering that arises from attachment, craving, and aversion.</li> </ol> Type of Dukkha Cause Explanation Dukkha-dukkha Physical or mental discomfort, illness, injury, death This is the suffering or pain that arises from physical or mental discomfort, illness, injury, or death. Samkhara-dukkha Attachment to conditioned phenomena This is the dukkha that arises from the impermanent and conditioned nature of all things. It includes the suffering that arises from not getting what we want, or getting what we don't want. It arises from our attachment to things that are ultimately unsatisfactory. Viparinama-dukkha Impermanence and change This is the dukkha that arises from the fact that all things are subject to change and decay, even pleasant experiences. It arises from the impermanent nature of all things, whether we are attached to them or not. <p>To clarify, the main difference between Samkhara-dukkha and Viparinama-dukkha is that Samkhara-dukkha refers specifically to the suffering that arises from our attachment to conditioned phenomena, while Viparinama-dukkha refers more broadly to the suffering that arises from the impermanent and changing nature of all things, including our attachment to them.</p> <p>Conditioned phenomena refer to all things that are dependent upon other causes and conditions for their existence, and are thus impermanent and subject to change. This includes all physical and mental phenomena, including the five aggregates of form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness, as well as all external objects and experiences.</p> <p>In Buddhism, the concept of conditioned phenomena is closely related to the notion of dependent origination (pratitya-samutpada), which states that all things arise in dependence upon a complex web of causes and conditions, and that there is no permanent, independent self or entity that exists in isolation from this network of interdependence.</p> Attribute Definition Dependent Origination The Buddhist doctrine that all phenomena arise in dependence upon other causes and conditions, and that there is no permanent, independent self or entity that exists in isolation from this network of interdependence. Impermanence The characteristic of all conditioned phenomena that they are subject to change, decay, and dissolution, and that they do not possess any inherent or permanent existence or identity. Interdependence The idea that all phenomena are interconnected and mutually dependent, and that nothing exists in isolation or independently of other factors or conditions. Five Aggregates The five components or aspects of experience that constitute the basis of individual existence in Buddhism: form (materiality), feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness. External Objects and Experiences All phenomena and experiences that are not part of one's internal mental or emotional states, but are instead perceived through the senses and interacted with in the external world.

inserts malicious SQL statements into an entry field, causing the database to execute unintended commands. 2 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) An attacker injects malicious code into a website, which is then executed by a user's web browser. 3 Broken Authentication and Session Management A flaw that allows an attacker to access user accounts or sessions without proper authentication or authorization. 4 Insecure Direct Object References A vulnerability that allows an attacker to manipulate data by modifying parameters that reference database objects directly. 5 Security Misconfiguration Improper configuration of security settings, such as weak passwords or open ports, can leave systems vulnerable to attack. 6 Insufficient Input Validation A vulnerability that arises when user input is not properly validated, allowing attackers to submit malicious input that can compromise the system. 7 Broken Access Control A vulnerability that allows an attacker to access unauthorized resources or perform unauthorized actions by bypassing access control measures. 8 Insufficient Cryptography Weak or poorly implemented encryption can leave sensitive data vulnerable to attack. 9 Injection Flaws Similar to SQL injection, these vulnerabilities allow an attacker to inject malicious code or commands into an application or database. 10 Malware Malicious software that can include viruses, worms, and Trojan horses, among others, can infiltrate systems and compromise data. <p>AI software is increasingly being used in the criminal justice system to determine bail, risk assessment, and other decisions. One example of such software is COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions), which is used in several states in the United States. COMPAS uses a proprietary algorithm to analyze data about an individual's criminal history, demographic information, and other factors to produce a \"risk score\" that judges can use in making decisions about bail and sentencing. However, the use of AI in the criminal justice system has been criticized for perpetuating bias and discrimination, particularly against marginalized communities.</p>"},{"location":"style_guide/active_voice/","title":"active voice","text":"<p>In the GitLab style guide1 , one of the recommendations is to use active voice instead of passive voice when writing code and documentation.</p> <p>Using active voice makes the code and documentation more clear and easier to understand. In active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action, while in passive voice, the subject receives the action. For example, instead of writing \"The function was called by the user,\" you can write \"The user called the function.\"</p> <p>Here are a few more examples of active voice:</p> <ul> <li>Use \"The function returns\" instead of \"A return value is provided by the function.\"</li> <li>Use \"We tested the application\" instead of \"The application was tested by us.\"</li> <li>Use \"The system handles errors\" instead of \"Errors are handled by the system.\"</li> <li>By using active voice, you can create more concise and direct statements, which can help improve the readability and maintainability of your code and documentation.</li> </ul> <p>Detecting passive voice with a regular expression can be a challenging task because it requires analyzing the syntactic structure of the sentence. However, there are some common patterns that you can look for to identify passive voice.</p> <p>One approach is to look for forms of the verb \"to be\" (such as \"is,\" \"are,\" \"was,\" \"were,\" etc.) followed by a past participle (such as \"called,\" \"tested,\" \"handled,\" etc.). Here is an example regular expression that looks for passive voice in a sentence:</p> <pre><code>\\b(be|am|is|are|was|were|been|being)\\b\\s+\\w+\\s+\\w+ed\\b\n</code></pre> <p>This regular expression matches a word boundary (\\b), followed by any form of \"to be\" (be, am, is, are, was, were, been, or being), followed by one or more whitespace characters (\\s+), followed by one or more word characters (\\w+), followed by a past participle ending in \"ed\" (\\w+ed\\b).</p> <p>To use this regular expression in practice, you can search for matches in your code or documentation and manually review the results to determine if they represent passive voice. Keep in mind that not all matches will necessarily be passive voice, and some instances of passive voice may not match this pattern. Therefore, it's important to use your judgment and understanding of English grammar when interpreting the results.</p> <p>Detecting passive voice using a sed script is more complicated than using a regular expression because it requires analyzing the context of the sentence. However, you can still use sed to perform some basic checks and highlight lines that might contain passive voice.</p> <p>Here's an example sed script that searches for lines containing forms of \"to be\" followed by a past participle and prints the line number:</p> <pre><code>#!/bin/bash\nsed -n '/\\b\\(be\\|am\\|is\\|are\\|was\\|were\\|been\\|being\\)\\b\\s\\+\\w\\+\\s\\+\\w\\+ed\\b/{=;}' $1\n</code></pre> <p>This script takes a filename as a command-line argument and uses sed to search for lines that match the regular expression pattern described above. The n flag tells sed to suppress output by default, while the search pattern enclosed in slashes (/pattern/) tells sed to look for lines that match the regular expression.</p> <p>The = command tells sed to print the line number for any lines that match the pattern. The semicolon (;) separates multiple commands on the same line.</p> <p>To run this script, save it to a file (e.g., passive-voice-sed.sh) and make it executable using chmod +x passive-voice-sed.sh. Then, run the script with the filename as an argument:</p> <pre><code>./passive-voice-sed.sh myfile.txt\n</code></pre> <p>This will print a list of line numbers that might contain passive voice. You can then review these lines manually to determine if they need to be revised. Keep in mind that this script is not foolproof and may produce false positives or miss some instances of passive voice, so it's important to use your judgment and understanding of English grammar when interpreting the results.</p> <p>To find line numbers containing passive voice using grep, you can combine it with the cat and nl commands to display the line numbers of matching lines. Here's an example command:</p> <pre><code>grep -nE '\\b(be|am|is|are|was|were|been|being)\\b\\s+\\w+\\s+\\w+ed\\b' myfile.txt | nl\n</code></pre> <p>This command searches for lines in myfile.txt that match the regular expression pattern for passive voice. The -n flag tells grep to include line numbers in its output, and the -E flag enables extended regular expressions. The nl command adds line numbers to the output of grep.</p> <p>The output of this command will be a list of line numbers and matching lines containing passive voice. You can then review these lines manually to determine if they need to be revised.</p> <p>Keep in mind that this command is not foolproof and may produce false positives or miss some instances of passive voice, so it's important to use your judgment and understanding of English grammar when interpreting the results.</p> <p>python module</p> <pre><code>import re\nimport os\ndef find_passive_voice(directory):\n\"\"\"\n    Find passive voice in all files in the specified directory.\n    Return a list of tuples containing the file path and line numbers where passive voice is found.\n    \"\"\"\n# Specify the regular expression for passive voice\npassive_voice_regex = r'\\b\\w+\\s+was|were\\s+\\w+ed\\b'\n# Create an empty list to store the results\nresults = []\n# Traverse the directory and search for passive voice in each file\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):\nfor file in files:\nif file.endswith('.txt'):  # Specify the file extension to search\nfile_path = os.path.join(root, file)\nwith open(file_path, 'r') as text_file:\nfor line_number, line in enumerate(text_file):\nif re.search(passive_voice_regex, line):\n# Append the file path and line number to the results list\nresults.append((file_path, line_number + 1))\nreturn results\n# Find passive voice in the specified directory\ndirectory = '/path/to/directory'\nresults = find_passive_voice(directory)\n# Write the results to an output file\nwith open('passive_voice.md', 'w') as f:\nfor file_path, line_number in results:\nf.write(f'{file_path}:{line_number}\\n')\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/ \u21a9</p> </li> </ol>","tags":["style guide"]},{"location":"style_guide/cartesian_doubt/","title":"cartesian doubt","text":"<ul> <li>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_doubt</li> <li>accepting only information you know to be true</li> <li>breaking down these truths into smaller units</li> <li>solving the simple problems first</li> <li>making complete lists of further problems</li> </ul>","tags":["workflow"]},{"location":"style_guide/complexity/","title":"cognitive complexity","text":"Cause Description Solution Nested conditionals A sequence of conditionals nested inside each other increases cognitive complexity.

It also suggests using tools like RuboCop, ESLint, or Prettier to automate formatting.</li> <li>Naming conventions: GitLab suggests using descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes. It also recommends using camelCase for variables and functions in JavaScript, and snake_case for variables and functions in Ruby.</li> <li>Comments: GitLab advises developers to write comments that explain why the code is written in a certain way, rather than what the code does. It also recommends avoiding unnecessary comments, such as commenting out code instead of deleting it.</li> <li>Testing: GitLab suggests writing automated tests for your code, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. It also recommends using a testing framework like RSpec or Jest.</li> <li>Documentation: GitLab recommends writing documentation for your code, including README files, inline comments, and API documentation. It also suggests using tools like Swagger to generate API documentation automatically.</li> <li>Security: GitLab advises following secure coding practices, such as avoiding hard-coded passwords, using secure libraries, and validating user input.</li> <li>Code reviews: GitLab recommends using code reviews to ensure code quality and catch potential bugs before they make it into production.</li> </ul> <p>These are just a few key points from the GitLab style guide.

Here's an example regular expression:</p> <pre><code>\\b(will|shall)\\s+\\w+\\b\n</code></pre> <p>This regular expression matches a word boundary (\\b), followed by either \"will\" or \"shall\" (will|shall), followed by one or more whitespace characters (\\s+), followed by one or more word characters (\\w+), followed by another word boundary (\\b).</p> <p>This pattern matches common constructions of future tense in English, such as \"will go,\" \"shall return,\" or \"will have finished.\" However, keep in mind that some expressions of future tense may not include an auxiliary verb or may use alternative constructions, such as \"going to\" or the present continuous tense. Therefore, it's important to use your judgment and understanding of English grammar when interpreting the results.</p> <p>grep</p> <p>To add line numbers to the output of grep when searching for future tense, you can use the -n flag to show line numbers and the -E flag to enable extended regular expressions. Here's an example command:</p> <pre><code>grep -nE '\\b(will|shall)\\s+\\w+\\b' myfile.txt\n</code></pre> <p>This command searches for lines in myfile.txt that match the regular expression pattern for future tense. The -n flag tells grep to include line numbers in its output, and the -E flag enables extended regular expressions.</p> <p>The output of this command will be a list of line numbers and matching lines containing future tense. You can then review these lines manually to determine if they need to be revised.</p> <p>Keep in mind that this command is not foolproof and may produce false positives or miss some instances of future tense, so it's important to use your judgment and understanding of English grammar when interpreting the results.</p> <p>sed</p> <pre><code>sed -n '/\\b\\(will\\|shall\\)\\s\\+\\w\\+\\b/{=;}' myfile.txt\n</code></pre> <p>python</p> <pre><code>import re\nimport os\n# Specify the directory to search\ndirectory = '/path/to/directory'\n# Specify the regular expression for future tense\nfuture_tense_regex = r'\\b(will|shall)\\s+\\w+\\b'\n# Specify the output file path\noutput_file = 'output.md'\n# Open the output file in write mode\nwith open(output_file, 'w') as f:\n# Traverse the directory and search for future tense in each file\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):\nfor file in files:\nif file.endswith('.txt'):  # Specify the file extension to search\nfile_path = os.path.join(root, file)\nwith open(file_path, 'r') as text_file:\nfor line_number, line in enumerate(text_file):\nif re.search(future_tense_regex, line):\n# Write the file name and line number to the output file\nf.write(f'{file_path}:{line_number + 1}\\n')\n</code></pre> <p>module</p> <pre><code>import re\nimport os\ndef find_future_tense(directory):\n\"\"\"\n    Find future tense in all files in the specified directory.\n    Return a list of tuples containing the file path and line numbers where future tense is found.\n    \"\"\"\n# Specify the regular expression for future tense\nfuture_tense_regex = r'\\b(will|shall)\\s+\\w+\\b'\n# Create an empty list to store the results\nresults = []\n# Traverse the directory and search for future tense in each file\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):\nfor file in files:\nif file.endswith('.txt'):  # Specify the file extension to search\nfile_path = os.path.join(root, file)\nwith open(file_path, 'r') as text_file:\nfor line_number, line in enumerate(text_file):\nif re.search(future_tense_regex, line):\n# Append the file path and line number to the results list\nresults.append((file_path, line_number + 1))\nreturn results\n</code></pre> <pre><code>import future_tense\ndirectory = '/path/to/directory'\nresults = future_tense.find_future_tense(directory)\n# Write the results to an output file\nwith open('output.md', 'w') as f:\nfor file_path, line_number in results:\nf.write(f'{file_path}:{line_number}\\n')\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/ \u21a9</p> </li> </ol>","tags":["style guide"]},{"location":"style_guide/troubleshooter/","title":"troubleshooting","text":"","tags":["root cause","troubleshooting"]},{"location":"style_guide/troubleshooter/#root-cause","title":"root cause","text":"<ul> <li>Define the problem: Clearly define the problem that needs to be solved, including its symptoms and effects.</li> <li>Gather data: Collect relevant data, including any available documentation, observations, and feedback from stakeholders.</li> <li>Analyze the data: Use tools such as flowcharts, cause-and-effect diagrams, and statistical analysis to identify patterns, trends, and possible causes.</li> <li>Determine the root cause: Identify the most likely root cause(s) of the problem based on the data analysis.</li> <li>Test the hypothesis: Test the hypothesis to confirm the root cause(s) and eliminate any other possibilities.</li> <li>Take corrective action: Develop and implement a plan to address the root cause(s) and prevent the problem from recurring.</li> <li>Monitor and evaluate: Monitor the results of the corrective action and evaluate its effectiveness over time.

The more consistent the error, the easier it is to find the cause.</li> <li>Check the error message: Python's error messages can be very helpful in pinpointing the source of the problem. Read the error message carefully and try to understand what it is telling you.</li> <li>Use print statements: Add print statements to the code to help identify where the code is breaking or to see what the value of a variable is at a specific point in the code.</li> <li>Use a debugger: Python has a built-in debugger that can be very helpful for tracking down issues. You can use it to step through the code line by line and see what is happening at each step.</li> <li>Check your assumptions: Make sure your assumptions about the code are correct. For example, check that the correct version of a library is installed, or that you are using the correct data types.</li> <li>Check for typos and syntax errors: Check for typos and syntax errors in the code, as these can often cause errors.</li> <li>Break the problem down into smaller parts: If you are having trouble finding the cause of the problem, try breaking the problem down into smaller parts and testing each part individually.</li> <li>Ask for help: If you have tried everything and are still stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help.
