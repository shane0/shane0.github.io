A fugue is a type of musical composition that is based on a theme, called a subject, which is introduced by one voice or instrument and then imitated by other voices or instruments in a contrapuntal manner. The subject is typically a short, melodic idea that is repeated and developed throughout the piece.

In a fugue, the subject is first presented by one voice or instrument, and then followed by other voices or instruments that enter one by one, each playing the subject in turn while the previous voice or instrument continues to play a variant of the subject or a related melody in counterpoint.

A fugue usually consists of several sections, including the exposition, where the subject is introduced and the voices or instruments enter one by one; the development, where the subject is varied and elaborated; and the recapitulation, where the subject is restated in its original form.

Fugues are often associated with the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, who is considered one of the greatest composers of fugues. However, fugues have been used by many other composers throughout the history of Western classical music, including Mozart, Beethoven, and Brahms.

| Fugue Technique | Description                                                                                                           |

| Exposition      | The opening section of a fugue where the main theme (subject) is introduced                                           |
| Answer          | The second voice or instrument that enters with the subject, usually a fifth or fourth higher or lower than the first |
| Episode         | A section of the fugue where the subject is not present and the other voices play free material                       |
| Stretto         | A technique where the subject is imitated by other voices in close succession, creating a sense of acceleration       |
| Inversion       | A technique where the intervals of the subject are reversed (i.e. a rising interval becomes a descending interval)    |
| Augmentation    | A technique where the duration of the subject is increased, usually by doubling or tripling the note values           |
| Diminution      | A technique where the duration of the subject is decreased, usually by halving or quartering the note values          |
| Counter-subject | A secondary melody that is played simultaneously with the subject and helps to create harmonic and rhythmic tension   |
| Pedal point     | A technique where a single note, usually in the bass, is sustained while the other voices move around it              |
| Coda            | The final section of a fugue, often featuring a final statement of the subject and a sense of resolution              |
