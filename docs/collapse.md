## if we could live forever

some researchers are exploring the use of CRISPR to modify genes that are involved in the aging process or that are implicated in specific diseases, with the {==aim of slowing or reversing the aging process==} or treating certain conditions.

Other researchers are investigating the use of CRISPR {==to regenerate tissues or organs by editing cells to create new cells that can replace damaged or aging cells==}

### total number of humans

it is thought that the total number of humans who have ever lived is somewhere between 100 billion and 120 billion

### the space that many would occupy

Assuming an average population density of 50 people per square kilometer, 120 billion people would require around {==2.4 million square kilometers of land area==}.

### land area

The total land area of the Earth is approximately {==148,940,000 square kilometers==}. This includes all the continents, islands, and other land masses on the planet. It is important to note that this number may vary slightly depending on how land area is defined and measured.

### earths capacity

Estimates of the Earth's carrying capacity for humans range widely, from as few as 1 billion to as many as 1 trillion or more, depending on assumptions and scenarios. However, most estimates fall within a range of 4 to 16 billion people, with the current global population of around 7.9 billion already exceeding the Earth's sustainable carrying capacity according to many experts.

## greed

Greed is often caused by a desire for more wealth or possessions, as well as a fear of not having enough. It can also be influenced by societal and cultural values, such as a focus on material success and competition. Additionally, some research suggests that biological factors, such as genetics and brain chemistry, may play a role in shaping individuals' propensity for greed.

### living without oil

- or worse without a sun (die by fire or morph into final form)

<iframe width="641" height="481" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RfwsvSjXkJU" title="Of Beauty and Consolation Episode 9 Edward Witten" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2021, as of the end of 2020, the world had proven reserves of about 1.3 trillion barrels of oil, which at current production rates would last about 47 years. The world also had proven reserves of about 7.6 trillion cubic meters of natural gas, which at current production rates would last about 55 years. Finally, the world had proven reserves of about 1732 billion tonnes of coal, which at current production rates would last about 149 years.

When the oil runs out, there will be significant impacts on the global economy and society. Oil is used not only as a source of energy for transportation and electricity generation but also as a raw material for many products, including plastics and chemicals.

Without oil, it is likely that the global economy would need to transition to alternative sources of energy, such as renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower, which may not be as efficient or as cost-effective as oil. There could also be significant geopolitical implications, as countries that are currently reliant on oil exports may need to find alternative sources of revenue and economic stability.

Additionally, without oil, there could be significant disruptions to global supply chains and the availability of goods, as many products rely on oil-based raw materials for production. Finally, there could be significant environmental impacts as well, as the extraction and use of oil have significant impacts on air and water quality, wildlife, and natural habitats.

> manipulating prices

Vincent Kosuga was a farmer who became known for his attempt to manipulate the potato market in the United States in the 1950s. He managed to gain control of a large portion of the potato market by buying up the entire potato crop from farmers across the country and holding onto it in storage facilities. He then waited for the potato prices to rise before selling the potatoes for a profit.

Kosuga's actions were not illegal, but they did raise concerns about the potential for individuals to manipulate commodity markets in this way. As a result of his actions, the government introduced new regulations to prevent market manipulation in the future.

Silos are used to manipulate agriculture prices by allowing buyers to hold onto their stocks of crops until prices increase. This is known as hoarding, and it can lead to a shortage of crops in the market, which drives prices up. By controlling the supply of crops, silos can create an artificial shortage, allowing the owners to charge higher prices. Additionally, silos can be used to store crops until they can be sold at a more favorable price, further manipulating the market.

> diamond silo

There is no way to accurately determine the value of diamonds that are kept in vaults and not sold, as this information is not publicly available. Diamond companies and traders generally do not disclose the exact amount of inventory they hold, and the value of diamonds can also vary depending on a number of factors such as size, color, and clarity. Additionally, the value of diamonds can fluctuate over time due to changes in market demand and other economic factors.

## genome

The Human Genome Project, which was completed in 2003, identified the complete sequence of human DNA, which is estimated to contain approximately 3 billion base pairs. Since then, continued research has led to a better understanding of the structure and function of the human genome. While the majority of the human genome has been identified, there is still much that is not fully understood.

It is estimated that only about 1-2% of the human genome encodes for proteins, the functional molecules that perform a wide range of tasks in the cell. The rest of the genome is made up of non-coding DNA, which was once thought to be "junk" but is now known to play important roles in regulation of gene expression and other cellular processes.

There is a wealth of evidence for evolution, from observations of the natural world to the fossil record to the molecular evidence of DNA. Here are some of the key lines of evidence:

Fossil record: The fossil record provides evidence of the evolution of species over time. Fossils of extinct species that were clearly distinct from any species alive today demonstrate that evolution has occurred.

Comparative anatomy: The similarities in anatomy and structure among different species can be explained by a common ancestry. For example, the bones of the forelimbs of mammals such as humans, bats, whales, and birds all have the same basic structure, despite their differences in function, indicating that they evolved from a common ancestor.

Biochemistry: The similarities in biochemistry and genetics among different species also provide evidence of evolution. For example, all living things use DNA as the genetic material, and the DNA sequences of different species are often similar in specific regions, reflecting a common ancestry.

Geographic distribution of species: The geographic distribution of species can also provide evidence for evolution. For example, many species that are found on the same continents or island groups are more similar to each other than to species found elsewhere, suggesting that they evolved from a common ancestor and have diversified over time.

Natural selection: Observing the process of natural selection in action, such as the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, provides further evidence of evolution. Natural selection is the mechanism by which evolution occurs, and by observing it, we can see how populations of organisms change over time.

These are just a few examples of the many lines of evidence that support the theory of evolution.

## what creature could most likely end humanity? ...most likely it's ourselves

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mosquitoes are responsible for an estimated 725,000 deaths per year.

However, if we consider the indirect impact of a species on human mortality (i.e., the impact on human health caused by a species, but not directly causing death), then humans themselves would be the species that kills the most humans, through wars, homicides, and other forms of violence.

If we consider only direct mortality (i.e., death caused by a specific species), the answer is mosquitoes, which are responsible for spreading diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever, and Zika virus, among others.

It's important to note that the numbers for both of these scenarios are estimates and can vary widely depending on the sources and methods used to gather data.

Additionally, there are other species, such as snakes, crocodiles, and sharks, which can also pose a significant threat to human life in certain regions or circumstances.

There are several factors that contribute to the ecological collapse of a region or the planet as a whole. Here are some of the most significant ones:

- Climate change: The burning of fossil fuels and deforestation are leading to rising levels of greenhouse gases, which are causing the planet to warm. This is leading to changes in weather patterns, melting of polar ice caps, and rising sea levels, which can have devastating impacts on ecosystems and the species that inhabit them.
- Habitat destruction: The destruction of natural habitats, such as forests, wetlands, and prairies, is causing the loss of biodiversity and making it difficult for species to adapt to changing conditions.
- Overfishing: Overfishing can cause a decline in fish populations, which can have ripple effects throughout ocean ecosystems and disrupt food webs.
- Pesticides and toxic chemicals: The widespread use of pesticides and other toxic chemicals can have negative impacts on wildlife, as well as on human health.
- Invasive species: Non-native species introduced into new environments can outcompete native species and alter ecosystems, often with negative impacts.
- Pollution: Pollution from sources such as factories, sewage treatment plants, and oil spills can have detrimental effects on wildlife and ecosystems.
- Overexploitation of resources: The extraction of resources such as water, timber, and minerals, can have negative impacts on ecosystems, leading to soil degradation and loss of biodiversity.
- Soil degradation: Soil degradation from factors such as deforestation, overgrazing, and improper agriculture practices can result in the loss of fertile land and make it difficult for plants and animals to thrive.
- Ocean acidification: The increase in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere is causing the oceans to become more acidic, which can have negative impacts on marine life and disrupt ocean ecosystems.
- Human population growth: The growing human population is putting increasing pressure on the planet's resources, leading to habitat destruction, deforestation, and overexploitation of resources, which can have negative impacts on the environment and wildlife.

Addressing these factors is critical for avoiding ecological collapse and ensuring the health and sustainability of ecosystems and the species that inhabit them. This will require a concerted effort from individuals, governments, and businesses to reduce emissions, conserve resources, and protect habitats.

## Population overshoot

<iframe width="835" height="470" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lPMPINPcrdk" title="Overshoot in a Nutshell: Understanding Our Predicament (31 min)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Population overshoot refers to a situation in which the population of a species, including human beings, exceeds the carrying capacity of its environment, resulting in a reduction of resources, degradation of ecosystems, and a decline in the quality of life for individuals and societies.

The concept of population overshoot is based on the idea that populations of all species are limited by the availability of resources, such as food, water, and habitat. When the population exceeds the carrying capacity of the environment, it results in competition for resources, and increased pressure on the environment. This can lead to the degradation of ecosystems, increased pollution, and a decline in the quality of life for individuals and societies.

The human population has been growing rapidly for the past few centuries, and it is estimated that the current global population of over 7.9 billion people is already beyond the carrying capacity of the planet. This has led to increasing concerns about the sustainability of human populations and the impacts of population overshoot on the environment, resources, and quality of life.

## Carbon-sucking unicorns

Carbon-sucking unicorns is a colloquial term that refers to unproven, highly speculative technologies that are promoted as a solution to the problem of climate change and carbon emissions. These technologies are often described as "miracle" or "silver bullet" solutions that will solve the problem of climate change without requiring significant changes to the current system.

Examples of carbon-sucking unicorns include the idea of large-scale deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, or the idea of "geoengineering" the climate by, for example, injecting reflective particles into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight back into space.

While these technologies may have some potential to address the problem of climate change, they are often criticized for being unrealistic, unproven, and based on a limited understanding of the complex and interconnected systems that regulate the Earth's climate. In addition, many of these technologies are seen as a way to avoid taking responsibility for reducing emissions and making the necessary changes to our lifestyles and economic systems.

It is important to remember that there is no single solution to the problem of climate change, and that a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach is necessary to address the problem effectively. This includes reducing emissions, promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy, and protecting and restoring ecosystems that help to regulate the Earth's climate.

## Techno-idolatry

Techno-idolatry refers to the worship or excessive veneration of technology and technological advancements, often to the point of disregarding other important values and considerations. It involves the belief that technology can solve all of society's problems, and that technology is an unmitigated good that can provide unlimited benefits.

Techno-idolatry is often accompanied by a belief in the unlimited potential of technology, and a disregard for the potential downsides and negative consequences of technological progress. For example, some proponents of techno-idolatry may view issues such as climate change, resource depletion, and social inequality as problems that can be solved through technological solutions alone, without considering the need for changes in economic systems, political structures, and individual behavior.

This approach to technology can be problematic because it ignores the fact that technology is not neutral, and that it can have unintended consequences that may harm the environment and society. It can also lead to a blind faith in technology, without critically examining its limitations and potential impacts.

To avoid the negative consequences of techno-idolatry, it is important to adopt a more balanced and nuanced approach to technology, one that recognizes its benefits while also acknowledging its limitations and potential downsides. This involves considering the ethical, social, and environmental implications of technological advancements, and striving to use technology in a responsible and sustainable way.

## The Seneca Curve

> Growth is slow, while the road to ruin is fast.

- seneca, philosopher 4bc

The Seneca Curve is a graphical representation of the idea that growth and collapse are inherent in complex systems, including human societies. The Seneca Curve is named after the Roman philosopher Seneca, who is said to have observed that growth in wealth and power is followed by a rapid decline.

The Seneca Curve is typically depicted as a graph that starts with slow growth, followed by a period of rapid expansion, and then a sharp decline. This pattern is thought to be the result of various factors, including the depletion of resources, the accumulation of waste, the loss of resilience and adaptability, and the creation of unsustainable systems.

The Seneca Curve has been applied to the study of the collapse of civilizations, including the Roman Empire, as well as to contemporary global challenges such as climate change, resource depletion, and economic instability. By understanding the dynamics of growth and collapse in complex systems, it is possible to develop strategies for avoiding or mitigating the consequences of collapse, and promoting long-term sustainability.

## cargo / globalization

The amount of gas a cargo ship would use on a trip depends on several factors such as the distance traveled, the size and efficiency of the ship's engines, the weather conditions, and the type of fuel used. However, as a rough estimate, a cargo ship carrying 200,000,000 tons of cargo could use anywhere from 1,000 to 3,000 metric tons of fuel per day, depending on the factors mentioned above. This means that for a trip of, say, 10 days, the ship could use anywhere from 10,000 to 30,000 metric tons of fuel.

The amount of CO2 produced by burning 30,000 metric tons of fuel would depend on the type of fuel being burned.

Assuming the fuel being burned is diesel, which produces approximately 2.68 kg of CO2 per liter of fuel burned, the amount of CO2 produced by burning 30,000 metric tons (30 million kilograms) of diesel would be approximately:

30,000,000 kg x 2.68 kg CO2/liter = 80,400,000 kg or 80,400 metric tons of CO2.

> Note: TEU stands for "Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit" and is a measure of a ship's cargo carrying capacity.
