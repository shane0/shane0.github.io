## brainstorming

- entropy and temporary pockets of life and complexity

```mermaid
quadrantChart
    title The Entropy of Life
    x-axis "Low Entropy (Order)" --> "High Entropy (Disorder)"
    y-axis "Low Complexity" --> "High Complexity / Vitality"
    "Crystalline Order": [0.15, 0.2]
    "Thriving Ecosystem": [0.4, 0.9]
    "Adaptive Organism": [0.6, 0.85]
    "Decay & Chaos": [0.9, 0.1]
```

```mermaid
quadrantChart
    title The Constant Battle: Energy Flow vs. Entropic Collapse
    x-axis "Low Entropy (Order)" --> "High Entropy (Disorder)"
    y-axis "Low/No Energy Flow" --> "High/Constant Energy Flow"
    "Equilibrium & Stasis (e.g., Crystal)": [0.2, 0.1]
    "Sustained Complexity (e.g., Life)": [0.4, 0.9]
    "Active Breakdown (e.g., Fire)": [0.8, 0.7]
    "Final Equilibrium (e.g., Dust)": [0.95, 0.05]
```
